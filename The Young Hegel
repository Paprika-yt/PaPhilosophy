# The Young Hegel  Studies in the Relations between Dialectics and Economics

By GEORG LUKACS

translated by Rodney Livingstone

MERLIN PRESS LONDON 1975

## Translator's Note .

Lukacs' terminology presupposes an audience familiar with the language of German idealist philosophy and of the Hegelian-Marxist tradition. To provide a key to that language would be a daunting and perhaps unrewarding task in the present context. At all events I have preferred simply to take over the vocabulary already developed by earlier translators, in the hope that Lukacs' own text and a few additional footnotes would suffice to render his argument comprehensible. It is for this reason that I have, wherever possible, made use of existing translations of the works of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Engels and Lenin, rather than compound the confusion by developing my own new language.

It may be of assistance to the reader to list here some of the key terms which recur throughout the book and indicate where explanations may be found, either in Lukacs' text, or in editorial footnotes. Other important concepts willbe found listed in the Index under Hegel:

1. Aufheben = annul, preserve, supersede or sublate. See p. 99.

2. BurgerlicheGesellschaft: used by Hegel to mean 'civil society' as opposed to political society. As such it can refer to any post-classical society, m which the 'civil' and the 'political' became distinct. (See esp. p. 375.) However, Lukacs tends to assimilate it to its modern meaning of 'bourgeois society'. I have tried to use the meaning that seemed right in the context.

3. The categories of Kantian philosophy, see p. 259.

4. Entiiusserung: one of the words for 'alienation'. I have preferred to translate it as 'externalization', since in Hegel's usage it has a broader application than the current term. See pp. 5 32 ff.

5. Erinnerung = (1) memory & (2) internalization. See pp. 508, 515.

6. Gestalten des Bewusstseins = the forms or configurations of consciousness. See pp. 474—5.

7. Infiniteprogress: see pp. 223—4.

8. Intellektuelle Anschauung= intellectual intuition, see pp. 246-7.

9. Rejlexionsbestimmungen = determinations of reflection. See p. 284.

Thanks are due to the following for permission to reprint material already translated: Lawrence & Wishart for quotations from the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin; George Allen & Unwin for quotations from J.B. Baillie's ttanslation of The Phenomenology of Mind; The Clarendon Press for quotations from Hegel's Political Writings, edited by Z.A. Pelczynski and translated by T.M. Knox and from Hegel's Philosophy of Right also translated by T.M. Knox; to University of Chicago Press, for quotations From T.M. Knox's translations of the early theological wriit-ings in Friedrich Hegel on Christianity, Harper & Row Torchbooks, New York 1961. I have occasionally modif ied     translations to adapt them to Lukdcs' argument (and once or twice, where Lukacs uses a different text).

I should also like to record a debt of gratitude to Prof essor Tony Manner and the other members of the Hegel Seminar at Southampton University whose discussions of the Phenomenology and the Logic over a period of two years greatly increased my understanding of Hegel. It is my hope that thanks to them I have become better able to avoid the numerous pit&lls that await the unwary translator of philosophical German texts.

## Preface to the new edition (1954)

This book was completed in late Autumn 1938. The imminent outbreak of war delayed its appearance for many yearss. In 1947/8, when publication became possible I thoroughly revised the text but because of the many other claims on my time I could only take account of a very small part of the literature on Hegel that had appeared since 1938. The present new edition for the German Democratic Republic has again been revised, but apart from stylistic improvements almost no changes have been made.

In the Introduction the reader will find a fiill account of the method-ological considerations that have guided the author throughout the work. On this point too I see no reason to modif y the positions adopted sixteen years ago. The attempts made in France to 'modernize' Hegel in an existential, irrationalist sense—above all in the well-known book by

Jean Hyppolyte—have not given me any cause to emend my arguments or even to supplement them. The fundamental critique given here of the picture of Hegel current in the Age of lmperialism* applies with equal force to these French efforts to provide a re-interpretation even though the conditions both internal and external for a 'Hegel Renaissance' in France must dif fer in many ways &om those in Germany.

I will perhaps be permitted to make a few remarks the benefiit of the German readers of my other, of ten later, works. My account of the development of the young Hegel supplements in many respects the ideas I have attempted to formulate in my other studies of the history of German philosophy and literature. Above all the present work contains a positive vision to contrast with the 'classical' age of irrationalism as presented in my work TheDestructionof Reason. In thatbook I examined the irrationalist tradition established by Schelling and hi$ successors. Here I shall be concerned with the critique and overcoming of irrationalism as seen From Hegel's side, though this in its turn isjust the negative, critical motif counterpointing the mam theme: the foundation of the new idealist, dialectical method. The two books mutually complement each other in yet other ways. Only in the present studies of Hegel was it possible to provide a positive explanation of why it was above all his philosophy that became the great stumbling-block for the irrationalisms of the period and why the latter rightly focused their attacks on him as the outstanding representative of the progressive bourgeois philosophy of the age. At the same time it becomes clear why the limitations and aberrations of Hegel's idealism could provide them with a real pretext for their critique of the dialectics of historicism and enable them to mount a relatively accurate attack upon it. Hence, From the examination and critique o f Hegel's early development, we can understand why irrationalism still possessed the vestiges of philosophical substance in Schelling's early period, and why it lost even this slightjus筋 cation later on in Nietzsche, once scienti&c socialism had appeared on the scene to oppose it. And if we are to understand not only the direct impact of Marx on the development of German thought but also his sometimes extremely indirect influence, an exact knowledge of Hegel, of both his greatness and his limitations, is absolutely indispensable.

• G.L. uses this phrase to refer to the period following the foundation of the German Empire m 1870, and more specif ically, the era of William II and the First World War.——Trans.

The same issue is equally crucial to the understanding of the golden age of German literature. I have pointed to the connections here From the standpoint of German literature in my studies of H61derlin and Heine, and above all in my discussions of Goethe's Faust. Since an analysis of The Phenomenology of Mind constitutes the core of the present work I have naturally attempted to demonstrate its profound intellectual and philosophical affinities with Faust so that the attentive reader will discover a perhaps not wholly idle complement to my earlier studies of Goethe's masterpiece from the opposite perspective. This applies with equal force to almost all the problems of a progressive German literature. One of the central tasks of German literary history is to settle accounts with the reactionary elements of Romanticism. The more reactionary the representatives of Romanticism were, the more they were glorif ied, and under the German Empire German literary historians either strove to blur the distinction between German Classicism and Romanticism or simply proclaimed their reactionary views openly and aggressively. Hence the intellectual reconstruction of the true situation is an important task for scholarship.

At the same time it is a task inseparable &om general issues of cultural politics. At a time when the people of Germany are fueling their way, when signif icant sections of the German intelligentsia have not made up their minds whether to move forwards or backwards, a correct view of the intellectual conflicts of the past can also act as a compass for the future. In my philosophical and literary studies I have always endeavoured to subordinate other aims to the great challenge posed by this fact. I believe that the elucidation of Hegel's own philosophy as well as of its connections with the progressive and reactionary currents of his age can likewise help to clarif y this urgent and important problem.

In all such ideological decisions the question of ones attitude to Marx is crucial. And this is not merely a matter of Marx's importance as thinker and politician, as philosopher, economist and historian: what counts is an understanding of what Marx has meant and still means in the context of German culture. It is three decades since Thomas Mann wrote

> 'I said that the state of Germany will not give cause for satisfaction, Germany will not be able to f nd its true self until Karl Marx has read Friedrich H61derlin—, an encounter which, by the way, is on the point of taking place. I forgot to add that if the acquaintance remains one-sided it will necessarily prove sterile.'

This is indeed a highly promising cultural programme, especially if the attempt is made to recover the authentic H61derlin——as the present writer has done here and elsewhere. It would be a dangerous illusion, however, to conclude that this programme has been even minimally realized by the mass of the German nation, and the disappearance of Marx from the cultural horizon of broad sections of the German people remains a source of weakness which can be seen daily and hourly in every sphere of activity. The German people has objectively weaker revolutionary traditions than other nations and cannot afford the luxury of renouncing thiscrucial asset.

The task of revitalizing the German tradition can be approached in a number of ways. One of them is to demonstrate the roots of Marx's work in Germany so as to show the extent of Marx's involvement with the progressive German tradition &om Lessing to Heine, &om Leibniz to Hegel and Feuerbach, and to prove how profoundly German his works are &om the structure of their thought down to his very style A correct historical analysis of Hegel which sets out &om Marxian perspectives can make a contribution to the solution of this problem.

Of course, the present work is primarily a scholarly exploration of facts and relations in philosophy and the history of philosophy. Its value is determined by the success with which it achieves a greater clarity in these matters than had existed previously. However, no knowledge can exist in isolation. A correct understanding of Hegel inevitably raises the questions we havejust outlined and the book is designed to clarif y them too. The author cannot pronounce on the success or filure of his enterprise but thinks it his duty to acquaint the reader Gankly with his intentions.

## Introduction

The history of the origins and development of classical German philosophy is an important and as yet unsolved problem in the Marxist history of philosophy. Even though the Marxist classics have repeatedly drawn attention to the extraordinary importance of the problem, even though Engels included Kant, Fichte and Hegel among the precursors of 由e philosophy of the revolutionary workers' movement, even though Marx and Lenin have brilliantly illuminated the central issues in a number of profound studies this story has not yet been fully explored.

We have not even arrived at the point of concretely unravelling the historical points of departure, of a concrete analysis of the available facts and texts, of a radical critique of the most important, false and misleading bourgeois theories on the subject.

For a long time the bourgeois interpretation of the origins and growth of classical German philosophy was dominated by the brilliantly original though idealistically distorted and in many respects schematic view established by Hegel himself. Hegel's pioneering historical insight consisted in his discovery that the various philosophical systems were connected by inner dialectical bonds. He was the first man to conceive of or otherwise of particular views of particular philosophers and to elevate it to the status of an authentic historical science. Within the context of the history of classical German philosophy Hegel discerned the starting-point for the meteoric rise of the dialectical philosophy of idealism in the 'transcendental', 'critical' philosophy of Kant and he rightly regarded his own system as the consummation and conclusion of the movement Kant had initiated. With great penetration and with profound insight into the most vital problems of dialectics (the thing-in-itself and the dilemmas it posed, the antinomies and the theory of contradiction, etc.) he perceived how Fichte's central preoccupations sprang &om the contradictions and inadequacies of the Kantian system, just as Fichte's own contradictions and faults led to Schelling and From there to himself.

the history of philosophy as something more than a mere collection of anecdotes and biographies, of metaphysical assertions about the validity ,

There is much truth in all this and much of great importance for a Marxist history of philosophy. But since Hegel, as an objective idealist, sees philosophy in terms of the autonomous movement of the concept he gets everything upside-down here too. Engels shows repeatedly that the various philosophical systems do indeed begin with the problems lefi unsolved by their predecessors, but as a dialectical materialist he also snows again and again that this purely philosophical analysis is peripheral to the real analysis and that the historian of philosophy must make the descent to the real, underlying objective foundations of the movement of philosophy. Whenever, as is the case with Hegel, the immediate manifestations of the history of philosophy are turned into idealist absolutes and treated 'immanently', i.e. as if the 'problems' of one philosophy lead smoothly to those of the jiext without the need to consider the realities underlying them, then even the grain of truth contained in such a history becomes exaggerated and distorted. In Hegel's own work the adoption of this procedure causes him to disregard the unevenness and complexity of the real development of philosophy even in this particular period. In consequence the highly complicated refections of actual historical events no less than the systematic efforts to incorporate developments in the natural sciences into a total dialectic are reduced to the 'immanent' combinations of a few—admittedly very important—categories.

This circumvention of the real world resulted in a schematic view of the history of philosophy and when bourgeois philosophy went into a decline it led to wholly unscientif ic distortions and misrepresentations of history.

During the Second International this schematic 'immanent' view even infected Marxists like Plekhanov and Mehring. The views of Menshevik idealism on the history of philosophy were powerlly reinforced by the errors and defects of Hegel's own interpretation. We can only establish a consistent Marxist-Leninist line on these problems if we overcome these errors, and thoroughly assimilate the philosophical advances made during the Leninist—Stalinist period of Marxism. Above all it is essential for us to study Lenin's philosophical works in depth. In any such history of classical German philosophy, in any such critical account of its development, the newly discovered and published works of Marx and Engels must also play a decisive role.

In bourgeois philosophy itself Hegel's conception of the history of philosophy did not long survive the defeat of the bourgeois revolution of 1848. Even before this period many other views emerged, more primitive than Hegel's and hostile to the real tendencies of history. The most important of these unhistoriical views, that of Arthur Schopenhauer, only became widely influential af^er 1848. Schopenhauer*s approach to philosophy is rooted in his conviction that the efforts of Fichte, Schelling and Hegel to resolve Kant's contradictions were nothing but aberrations. According to Schopenhauer, philosophy should revert to the only correct method, that of Kant; anything else was deception, idle talk, a swindle. On the one hand, then, Schopenhauer simply repudiates the entire dialectical development of classical German philosophy and calls for a return to a metaphysical conception of reality. On the other hand, he 'purif ies' Kant of his hesitant steps towards materialism; he brings Kant and Berkeley together under one umbrella. (In many respects Herbarit has a not dissimilar effect, different though he is in other ways.)

This view, which amounts to the total annihilation of the history of classical German philosophy, reappears later in the neo-Kantians in an even more philistine form. This can be seen most clearly in the works of Otto Liebmann (Kant and his successors, 1865, etc.). With Liebmann we witness the philosophical triumph of that German neo^Kan^ianism which succeeded in transforming Kant into a thorough-going subjectivist and agnostic and which repudiated as 'unscientif ic metaphysics' every attempt to know objective reality as it is, independently of consciousness. This signif ies the victory in neo-Kantianism of the Schopen-hauerian line of the history of philosophy with its interpretation of post-Kan^ian philosophy as a single great aberration &om the uniquely true subjectivism of Kant. The main dif erence is that here it is done more prosily, without Schopenhauer's genius for picturesque abuse. Hegel is treated as a 'dead dog .

This view dominates most of the histories of classical German philosophy dating &om about the middle of the last century, above all in their treatment of Hegel. Undoubtedly, remnants of Hegelianism in a National Liberal and trivialized form still survive. This can be seen in the well-known histories of philosophy by Kuno Fischer and J. E. Erdmann. However, the most important book on Hegel in this period, the work of Rudolf Haym, is in the last analysis one long diatribe against Hegel's 'unscientif ic' treatment of objectivity and of dialectics.

The study of classical German philosophy was not resumed until the Age of Imperialism. By that time liberal neo-Kantianism was increasingly failing to satisfy the ideological needs of Germany's imperialist bourgeoisie. We see instead the emergence of doctrines which, while they leave the agnostic foundations of neo-Kan^ianism intact, nevertheless were searching for ways in which to bring about a reactionary revival of objective idealism. (Examples are the Romantic revival, 'Lebensphilosophie', Husserl's 'phenomenology', Dilthey's 'realist psychology' etc.) Intimately bound up with these reactionary tendencies we find a revival of classical German philosophy, primarily of Hegel. At the same time there was a renewed interest in the problem of its origins and this attempted to advance beyond both the schematicism of the la^er Hegelians and the out-and-out rejection of Hegel by the orthodox neo-Kantians.

Evidently, the 'renaissance' of classical philosophy in the Age of lmpe-rialism did not imply the renewal or extension of Hegelian dialectics, nor did it bring about the concretization of Hegel's historicism. Instead it represented the attempt to press Hegel's philosophy into the service of an imperialist, reactionary restructuring of neo-Kantianism. In line with this the theoreticians and historians at the start of the neo^Hegelian revival aimed their polemics above all against those arguments which set up Kant and Hegel as mutually exclusive opposites. The neo^Hegelianism o^lmperialism turned a blind eye to the profound and annihilating criticism which Hegel levelled at Kant's subjectivism and agnosticism. Its basic tenet was the unity of classical German philosophy, and of Kant and Hegel above all. All these philosophers (Windelband, J. Ebbinghaus, Brunstad, etc.) endeavoured to prove that all the problems of Hegel's philosophy could already be found in Kant and that Hegel only made conscious and explicit what had been present unconsciously and implicitly in Kant. This gave rise to a view of history in which the Hegelian scheme of the development of classical German philosophy was reiterated and renovated only in appearance, and which therefore contained all its idealist and schematicizing errors in an intensif ied form. In reality this'view was wholly incompatible with Hegel's own. Hegel had severely criticized the errors of his predecessors丘om the standpoint of objective idealism and of dialectics while at the same time he singled out for particular praise and appreciation the historical signif icance of those incipient attempts to formulate and solve dialectical problems. The neoHegelians of Imperialism proceeded in the opposite direction. They deduced Hegel From Kant, i.e. they took notice only of those elements of

,

Hegel that could readily be reconciled with Kantian agnosticism. They reduced the whole development of classical German philosophy to a Kantian level. This tendency can still be seen quite clearly in neoHegelianism af^er the (First) World War—when it is frequently accompanied by other and even more openly reactionary moti& Hermann Glockner, the editor of the new edition of Hegel's works and one of the leaders of the post-war neo-Hegelians, put the matter clearly in his speech to the first Hegel Congress:

'In Germany today the problem of Hegel is primarily a problem of Kant.'

In this context we can only briefly refer to the general class foundations and political background to 击is changing picture of Hegel. A comparison will best put the new situation into perspective. When Havm in his day had attacked Hegel's objectivism and his dialectics he had done so in the service of liberalism, albeit a liberalism inclining towards National Liberalism. At any rate, while completely misunderstanding the dialectical character of Hegel's views he dismissed them as reactionary and believed that the growth of a liberal ideology would be greatly facilitated by the demise of Hegel's philosophy. By contrast, for Friedrich Meinecke, the well-known historian of the Age of Imperialism and the close associate of the neo^Kantians of south-west Germany

(Windelband and Rickert), HegeFs philosophy was essentially the precursor of Bismarck's politics ana h^s view of the state. When Haym was writing, the resistance of the German bourgeoisie to the foundation of the Bismarckian Empire, to the pseudo-constitutional, reactionary character of the German state was still alive, even though en^ebled by liberal timidity and inconsequentiality. The later revival of Hegelianism can be seen to be closely connected with the Get that all traces of this resistance had now vanished. Neo-Hegelianism set out to propagate an ideology of concrete and positive, and in effect, total 'reconciliation' with the political form of Germany. It is obvious, therefore, that the reactionary elements of Hegel's philosophy necessarily receive the great

est prominence.

Such reactionary elements, however, are not confined to political history. The neo-Hegelians we have been discussing were striving to extend and modernize neo-Kantianism to the point where it en^ compasses the entire history of classical German philosophy. But this was fir Eom being enough to satisfy the reactionary ideological require-

ments of the Age of lmperialism. We have already mentioned the grow

ing influence of irrationalist 'Lebensphilosophie'. The gre enjoyed by Dilthey's contribution to the revival of Hegel

at popularity pan np trarpn —an back to the Get that here Hegel's dialectics are distorted so as to harmonize with the emergence of philosophical irrationalism. In this sense Dilthey's monograph of 1906 on the young Hegel betokens a turning-point in the history of Hegel-stud^es. The crux of the matter is that Dilthey meets the imperialist and reactionary revival of Romanticism halfway when—by ignoring or distorting the most vital historical facts —he brings Hegel within the orbit of philosophical Romanticism.

In the post-war period neo-Hegelianism proceeded along the paths laid down by Dilthey while also drawing on the philosophical results of the other neo-Hegelian trends. Richard Kroner in his From Kant to Hegel, a book of decisive importance for the later development of neo^ Hegelianism, argues that 'Dialectics is irrationalism made rational, made into a me出od'. The general aim of neo-Hegeliian^sm—Nearly reflected in the speeches of Glockner, Kroner, etc.,——is to make apparent use of Hegel's approach to the philosophy of history, to exploit his concept of 'reconciliation', in order to achieve a 'synthesis' of all contemporary philosophical movements (including Fascism).

It is no accident that Dilthey's monograph which focuses its attention on Hegel's youth should stand at the beginning of this whole develops ment. Dilthey believed that he had discovered certain motiR in Hegel's transitional phase, and especially in the moments of crisis during that phase, which were susceptible to exploitation by an irrationalist, mystical interpretation of Hegel. Much earlier he had similarly Glsihed H61derlin, the Giend and companion of Hegel in his youth. (I have

provided a detailed critique of this reactionary falsif ication of HOlderlin in my essay on his Hyperion——See Goethe and His Age, London ^^8, pp. 136-57.) Dilthey's irrationalist view of Hegel's philosophy reintroauced into it certain tendencies derived &om the German dissolution of Hegelianism. Thus late in lif ^ the famous Hegelian aesitheitician, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, turned away &om his own Hegelian beginnings and erected an irrationalism theory of myth to oppose Hegel's dialectics. Dilthey now irjected this theory into the interpretation of Hegel himself. (On this subject see my essay Karl Marx and Friedrich Theodor Vischer in Beitrage zur Geschichte der Asthetik, Aufbau Verlag, Berlin 1953-)                            ,

As we have seen, Dilthey's interpretation of Hegel played a decisive role in the later development of neo^Hegelianism. With his book the figure of the young Hegel, who had been peripheral for Kuno Fischer or Haym, now moved steadily into the fore&ont of attention. Increasing use was made of Hegel's sketches and notes, most of them not intended fix publication, and they were interpreted in such a way as to give birth to a 'true German' philosopher, i.e. a mythical, irrationalism figure palatable to Fascism. This development reaches its pinnacle in Theodor Bering's monograph of which the first volume appeared in i 929.

Although the perversion of the history of philosophy in Germany reaches a climax here, at least as far as Hegel is concerned, the whole movement has had the positive effect of having made possible the publi-cagn of the scattered, concealed or forgotten manuscripts of Hegel's yo'Jth. We are now at a point where we can begin to chart Hegel's early de 冷 lopment.

I;;append a list of the most important of these publications as constant r^fierence to them will be necessary in the course of our concrete analysis of his youthful development.

1. Hegel's Early Theological Writings, ed. Hermann Nohl, Tubingen 19D7 (ciited here as 'Nohl').

2. The German Constitution and the System of Ethics, both published in Schrif ten zur Politik und Rechtsphilosophie Hegels by G. Lasson, Leipzig 1923 (ciited here as 'Lasson').

,3，Hegel's Jena Logic, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Nature, ed. G. Lasson, Leipzig 1923 (cited here as the Jena Logic).

4. Hegel's lectures From the period immediately prior to The Phenometrology of Mind, published under the title Jenenser Realphilosophie, Vols. I and II byj. Hof fimeis^er, Leipzig 193 I (cited here as Realphilosophie).

5. Documents on Hegel's Development, ed.J. Hof f^eis^er, Stuttgart 1936 (cited here as 'Hof f^eis^er').

Taken together, all these publications amount to a fairly sizable and as yet barely tapped mine of information about the emergence of the Hegelian dialectic. In part, work on this topic has been rendered easier by the philological research that accompanied the publication and interpretation of these texts. With the aid of the letters and manuscripts that can be dated with certainty, Nohl, Hof fmeister, Haering, Rosen-zweig and others have carried out a detailed investigation into the chronology of Hegel's manuscripts. They have established with precision the changes in Hegel's handwriting and with the help of such information they have managed to provide the individual manuscripts with exact or approximate dates. As we have been unable to test their results we shall have to accept their chronology except where the philosophical content forces us to deviate from it.

This should not be taken to mean that we now possess all the documents pertaining to Hegel's early development or that all those we do have are in a satisfactory state from the point of view of scholarship. The original editors of Hegel's literary remains dealt with the material entrusted to them in an amazingly high-handed and irresponsible manner. It appears that a number of the most important manuscripts have been irretrievably lost. Examples of this are the first economic manuscript from his period in Frankfurt and above all the extended commentary on Steuart's works. We shall see very clearly in Part II just what the loss of this particular manuscript has meant for any attempt to reconstruct the development of Hegel's views on economics. Rosenkranz, who still had it in his possession, had not the slightest idea of the part played by economics in Hegel's overall views. From his remarks alone we cannot come to any conclusion about them. This means that at a decisive turning point in Hegel's development we are reduced to hypotheses, constructions based on scattered comments, deductions from later writings, etc.

Moreover, even in the case of manuscripts published entirely or in part by Rosenkranz there is much to be desired from a scholarly point of view. For example, in his account of Hegel's life he has printed extracts from Hegel's historical notes from his period in Berne and philosophical comments from his time in Jena, but without stating when precisely in these periods the notes, etc., were made. As he possessed the manuscripts himself this would not have been too dif ficult a task. Today, however, with the manuscripts long since lost, we must again have recourse to ingenious guesswork. The importance of the published notes for our understanding of Hegel's development is very great, and sometimes even crucial. The Berne notes, for instance, contain a number of comments on the French Revolution. It would be of very great value if we could establish an exact chronology here, if we could determine the various phases of Hegel's attitude on this issue, and learn, for example, which events m the French Revolution provoked immediate reactions from him. In the case of the Jena philosophical notes an exact chronology would be even ^^re desirable. It is well known that in Jena Hegel at first sided with Schelling against Kant and Fichte and it was only with the introduction to The Phenomenology of Mind that he turned against Schelling too. Now the Jena notes contain critical comments on Schelling's students and on Schelling himself. It is evident that if we knew exactly when Hegel turned against Schelling, undoubtedly some time before he published anything overtly critical of him, we would be able to establish a much more concrete view of Hegel's development than is possible today. Thus in making use of this material we can only establish the changes in Hegel's views in a very general way.

Nevertheless, despite all these defects and lacunae we still possess a relatively substantial body of material on Hegel's early development. And since Fascistoid neo-Hegelianism has settled on precisely this period as suitable for turning Hegel into an irrationalist consonant with their Own views, the task of confronting their falsif ications with the historical facts is by no means unimportant. All the more since the spirit of the 'new science' has now infected even Marxist writings, availing itself of the circumstance that Marxists have hitherto scarcely concerned themselves at all with Hegel's youth. Thus during the Hegel Centenary of 1931 the pseudo-Marxists simply took over and disseminated word for word Dilthey's interpretation of his early development.

However, our interest in Hegel's early development goes beyond the polemical demolition of Fascist lies. Considered from a Marxist point of view it is obvious that we are faced with a very important stage in the growth of dialectics in Germany. A correct Marxist interpretation even of Hegel's later works cannot remain indifferent to the road which led Hegel to his later positions. We thus acquire a much more concrete knowledge of his point of view vis-a-vis his predecessors Kant, Fichte and Schelling. The legend of his connections with Romanticism is revealed to be wholly untenable. In a word——and as is self-evident to a Marxist——we can gain an incomparably better insight into Hegel if we follow the story of its genesis than if , following the method adopted by Hegel himself we were to compare and contrast e.g. the mature works of Schelling with the mature works of Hegel without taking genetic questions into account.

The development of Hegel's philosophy also poses all the great historical questions concerning the general foundations of classical German philosophy and the development of the dialectical method into the Hegelian form of dialectics. The present work makes no claim to deal with this extraordinarily large problem in the context of Hegel's own personal development. It prefers to confine itself to one of its strands, viz. its socio-historical roots.

For the growth of dialectics in classical German philosophy was also influenced to a decisive extent by the contemporary crisis in the natural sciences, by the extremely important discoveries which upset the foundations of previous scientif ic thought, by the rise of the new science of chemistry and the emergence of genetic problems in the most disparate sciences. In his book on Feuerbach Engels gives a very detailed account of the impact of these revolutions in the natural sciences upon the crisis in metaphysics and the sudden surge of philosophy towards a dialectical approach to reality.

This extremely important process has never been thoroughly investigated. Bourgeois historians of philosophy have for a long time looked down their noses at the 'speculations into the philosophy of nature' (Naturphilosophie) indulged in by the classical German philosophers. In the middle and end of the nineteenth century Marx and Engels were the only thinkers who were able to see clearly and to appreciate the real problems of this period notwithstanding the idealist and even absurdly mystical form in which they became manifest. On this point Engels writes in the Preface to the Anti-Duhring as follows:

'It is much easier, along with the unthinking mob a la Karl Vogt, to assail the old natural philosophy than to appreciate its historical signif icance. It contains a great deal of nonsense and fantasy, but not more than the unphilosophical theories of the empirical natural scientists contemporary with that philosophy, and that there was also in it much that was sensible and rational began to be perceived after the theory of evolution became widespread . .. The natural philosophers stand in the same relation to consciously dialectical natural science as the utopians to modern communism.'

A Marxist approach to these problems would presuppose a broad and thorough acquaintance with the detailed histories of all the natural sciences. The present writer does not feel competent even to broach these issues. The intention of these remarks is only to emphasize to the reader that the present study is necessarily one-sided and stands in need of further research from other quarters.

This additional research is necessary and urgent and not merely for the reasons given above. We must add that contemporary reactionary philosophies of the Age of Imperialism have a much more positive attitude to natural philosophy than their predecessors. But this only complicates and distorts the issue even further. For in their search for weapons to use against scientif ic interpretations of nature the modern students of natural philosophy have fixed upon the nonsense, the mysticism, the elements that are scientif ically reactionary. Hence an investigation of the true relations between the developments in science and the origins of the dialectical method implies at the same time taking up arms against the ann-scientif ic the ones of Fascism and its precursors.

Our present study will concern itself with another, no less important complex of problems relating to the emergence of dialectics in classical German philosophy, namely with the effects of the great socio-political events of the period, and in particular with the French Revolution and its impact on the growth of dialectical modes of thought in Germany.

The impact of the French Revolution on Germany is another theme which stands in need of further study. Bourgeois historiography, above all after 1848, strove constantly to obliterate the memory of all democratic and revolutionary aspirations in Germany. Today we know extraordinarily little of the many Germans who directly supported the French Revolution. Georg Forster is the only one who has not sunk into total oblivion, doubtless because he already had a wide reputation as a scientist and journalist, although even in his case a genuine Marxist analysis of his works and his activity does not yet exist. But Forster is only one among many, and an overall view of the impact of the French Revolution would only be possible if all the facts were considered in their breadth and depth. A further important but neglected problem is that of assessing the opinions of the broad masses of the people, since it is clear from Goethe's various memoirs, for all his extreme caution in describing such matters, that public opinion was profoundly disturbed by the events in France.

Any such study would be forced to give due weight to the backwardness, both political and socio-economic, of Germany at that time. The individual utterances and attitudes of Germans on the subject of the French Revolution must constantly be judged with this in mind. Hence the categories which in France emerged and developed as the necessary consequence of actual class struggles cannot be applied mechanically to the ideological reflections of these struggles in a retrograde Germany. It should not be forgotten, for example, that in France even the Girondins took part in the meetings at the Jacobin Club for a long time and that clear differences between the parties only emerged as the class struggles became more acute. It would therefore be mechanical and mistaken to attach the political labels of the French Revolution to individual German attitudes and positions when comparable social differences only arose much later in Germany.

This brings us to yet another problem of enormous importance, the central problem of the bourgeois revolution in Germany. It is well known that Lenin singled out the creation of national unity in Germany as the crucial issue confronting that revolution. Now the enthusiasm for the French Revolution necessarily released a powerful wave of patriotism in Germany, a powerful desire to sweep away the atomized mass of feudal absolutist states, to put an end to the impotence of the nation as a whole. There was a profound longing for a free and united Germany. But the foundations of these tendencies in world history conceal an insoluble contradiction. Writing on the Spanish war of liberation

against Napoleon, Marx states that as in every comparable liberation

movement of the time ,reaction goes hand in hand with regeneration'.

This profound observation fully applies to Germany as it was then. On the one hand, the revolutionary wars of the French Republic necessarily turned into wars of conquest. And if Napoleons victories did away with any mysticism. They were not strong enough to throw off the yoke of the petty princes by revolution and so they were unable to organize resistance to the Napoleonic invasion on a national and democratic footing. Indeed, they were so weak that they were unable even to see the problem in these terms and they attempted instead to organize resistance in league with, or rather under the leadership, of, the reactionary monarchies of Prussia, Austria, etc. With historical inevitability they became the objective pillars of the reaction that dominated Germany after the fall of Napoleon.

the vestiges of feudalism, particularly in the Rhineland, thus satisfying the objective requirements of the bourgeois revolution, such conquests inevitably increased the fragmentation and impotence of the German people. On the other hand, as a consequence of Germany's backward social structure the national movements became permeated by reaction

These contradictions can be seen in the life, the thought and the deeds of all outstanding Germans of this period.Whether we look at generals and statesmen such as Baron vom Stein, Gneisenau or Scharnhorst, at he immediately adds that the problems become gravely distorted by the backward condition of Germany.

poets like Goethe and Schiller, or at philosophers like Fichte and Hegel —in every case we find their lives dominated by these contradictions and the impossibility of resolving them.

Hence the historian of this period is faced by the complex, two-fold task of surveying both the great, world-historical event and also its distorted reflection in a retrograde Germany. Marx has described this situation in his remarks on Kant in 1 he German Ideology. In Kant's thought he finds echoes of 'French liberalism with its basis in real class interests'. And

'Therefore, Kant [he continues] separated this theoretical expression from the interests it expressed, made the materially inspired determinations of the will of the French bourgeoisie into pure selfdetermination of the "free will", of will in and for itself, of human will as such, and so he transformed the will into a set of purely ideological concepts and moral postulates.'

Here Marx has discovered and brilliantly formulated one of the chief reasons why philosophy had to develop in the direction of idealism in Germany. And with this Marx points with equal precision to the inevitable deformation of philosophical problems necessarily arising from idealism.

However, the historical problems of this epoch in the history of philosophy are by no means all solved by pointing to the origins of idealism and energetically criticizing its failings. Marx himself, in his Theses on Feuerbach, underlines the positive contribution of classical idealism. After criticizing the merely contemplative character of the old materialism he goes on:

'Hence it happened that the active side, in contradistinction to materialism, was developed by idealism——but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such.'

With these words Marx provides the essential lever with which to initiate a precise, prof itable and genuinely historical critique of Hegelianism, the sort of critique that Lenin was to give many decades later in the brilliant commentaries on Hegel in his own early writings.

The task facing the historian of classical German philosophy can be defined as the need to provide a concrete account of the fruitful effects of this 'active side' for dialectics. He must show how the reflection of great, world-historical events in a backward Germany produces this idealist abstraction from real human activity and at the same time he must demonstrate that this abstract and partly distorted reflection of reality leads philosophers to their original insights into specific general principles of activity, movement, etc. The task of the historian would be all too simple if he could rest content with a demonstration of the negative consequences of Germany's backwardness. The world-historical role of classical German philosophy in the history of human thought is a fact that must itself be explained in Marxist terms from the concrete state of society at the time.

Thus Marx and Engels have provided us with a key to the critique of classical German philosophy. But here too the tradition they initiated evaporated during the Second International. The theme launched by Marx was dropped and not resumed and taken a step further until Lenin. Concerning his contemporaries' criticism of Kant he writes:

'I. Plekhanov criticises Kantianism (and agnosticism in general) more from a vulgar materialist than from a dialectical-materialist standpoint: he tends only to reject their arguments a limine, instead of correcting them (as Hegel corrected Kant) by deepening, expanding and universalizing them and by showing the connections and transitions between all the different concepts. 2. The Marxists criticised the Kant-ians and the supporters of Hume (early in the twentieth century) more after the manner of Feuerbach or Ludwig Buchner than of Hegel.'

It is evident that these important remarks of Lenin's apply with equal force to the methodology of the historical and critical treatment of

Hegel's philosophy.

Engels has finely and convincingly shown in a letter how hegemony in philosophy passed in succession from England to France and from France to Germany and that the leading philosophical nation is not always the nation that is most advanced economically and socially; maturity in economic development does not always coincide with philosophical maturity and here too the law of unequal development applies.

The seminal and original insights of classical German philosophy are intimately bound up with the way in which they reflect the great political events of the period. In the same way the darker sides both of the method of idealism and of its elaboration of particular points are the mirror images of Germany's backwardness. Our task is to unravel the complicated workings of this process of interaction and to reveal the living dialectical core of the development of classical German philosophy.

We repeat: the central historical events whose intellectual reflections we have to investigate are the French Revolution and the resulting class struggles in France with their consequent impact on internal German problems. And in general it can be said that the greatness of the ideological representatives of this period stands in direct proportion to the strength of their interest in events of world-historical, international moment. Fichte's philosophy reached a dead-end because he could not resolve the contradictions of a national democratic revolution in Germany. By contrast, in Goethe's works and in Hegel's The Phenomenology of Mind and the Logic we have books which have exerted a decisive influence on the whole ideological development ever since.

However, there is a special feature of Hegel's position and of his preoccupation with the significant world-historical events of the day which sets him apart from all his contemporaries in philosophy. It is not only the case that he made the greatest and fairest German assessment of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic period. In addition, he is the only German thinker to have made a serious attempt to come to grips with the industrial revolution in England. He is the only man to have forged a link between the problems of classical English economics and those of philosophy and dialectics. Marx has shown in The German Ideology how the French materialists clothed economic ideas in an abstract philosophical form which corresponded to the needs of a bourgeoisie preparing itself for revolution. He shows further how these ideas returned to England to receive a more concrete economic form which, given the ideology of what was already a dominant bourgeoisie, inevitably led to a total philosophical trivialization (cf. Marx on Bentham). On the other hand, the multi-faceted opposition to the social arid economic effects of the rise of capitalism constitutes one of the most important sources of Romanticism. In his dialectical grasp of these problems Hegel

is as far removed from Benthamite superficiality as he is from the false and reactionary 'prof Undity' of Romanticism. His purpose is rather to grasp the true inner structure, the real motive forces of the present and of capitalism and to define the dialectic of its movement.

It would be an error to search for evidence of this tendency of Hegelian philosophy only in those comments which expressly and directly

refer to the problems of capitalist society. His preoccupation with this theme in fact determines the structure of his system and the particular character of the dialectic as well as the greatness of his achievement. It is at this point that we find one of the chief sources of his superiority as philosopher and dialectician over his contemporaries. Our study aims to show at least in outline how this process of interaction informed the development of the young Hegel. It will demonstrate that during one crisis in his life, at a time when he had become estranged from the ideals of the great contemporary revolution, he found his way out of the labyrinth and back to dialectics with the aid of a compass provided by political economy and inparticular the economic condition of England. We shall attempt to show in detail at this point just how crucial was his understanding of economic problems for the emergence of a consciously dialectical mode of thought.

This interpretation of Hegelian philosophy is neither more nor less than the attempt to apply to his early development the brilliant insight formulated by Marx in his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of I 844:

'The greatness of Hegel's Phenomenology is then . .. that Hegel views the self-creation of man as a process . . . and therefore that he grasps the nature of labour and understands objective man, true, because real man as the product of his own labour.'

Marx shows here the extent to which Hegelian philosophy forms an analogue of English classical economics. Of course, in England the concrete problems of bourgeois society appear in the form of concrete economic laws, while Hegel can do no more than supply the abstract (idealist) reflection of their general principles. As against this it may be observed that Hegel is the only person who grasps the dialectical character of this movement and can advance from there to a general theory of dialectics. (I must remind the reader once again that even so we have touched on only one aspect of the origins of Hegelian dialectics.)

From the foregoing it will be apparent to the reader that for all the magnitude of this view of the dialectics of human society it still remains an idealist dialectic with all the faults, limitations and distortions inevitable in an idealist interpretation. And the task of this study is indeed to throw light on the vital interaction of the valuable and the weaker sides of Hegel's dialectics at the various stages of his development. The present writer hopes that his work will shortly be followed by others which will

correct and supplement the one-sidedness of his historical approach; works which will deal with the influence of the natural sciences upon dialectics. Not until we have such studies will it be possible to gain an

overall view of Hegel's development. Such works will doubtless concretize and correct some of the conclusions of the present work. The present writer nevertheless entertains the hope that as far as is possible within the limitations of the source material available at present, his account of Hegel's development is correct in its broadoutlines.

If we have achieved this goal then we shall have succeeded in establishing a methodological perspective in the history of philosophy which in importance goes beyond the mere understanding of Hegel's early development: we refer to the inner connections between economics and philosophy, economics and dialectics. In the course of time historians of philosophy have increasingly found themselves compelled to go beyond the confines of philosophical problems in the narrow sense and to direct their attention towards the historical development of human thought across the whole spectrum of the special sciences. Naturally enough, they have tended and still tend to concentrate above all on the natural sciences. A study of the interactions between science on the one hand, and philosophical method, epistemology and logic on the other has yielded not inconsiderable results, even though it has constantly suffered from its overemphasis on the agnosticism of Kant or Berkeley and Hume as the criterion of its method and so has heedlessly neglected the complex interrelations between a philosophically conscious (albeit idealist) dialectic (German natural philosophy) and the dialectic which sprang——somewhat obscurely——from scientific practice (Lamarck, Darwin, etc.). In contrast to this the methodological connections between philosophy and the theoretical understanding of the phenomena of society have hitherto attracted scarcely any attention.

Not by chance, as we believe. The explanation is to be found in social factors and their development. In the early stages of bourgeois economics the great innovators of this novel science regarded it, on the one hand, as the basic science of society and, on the other hand, with true artlessness and frankness they thought of the categories of economics as the repositories of relations between men. At a later stage, however, the fetishism of economic categories which develops necessarily and increasingly with the advance of capitalism penetrated further and further into the methodology of the social sciences. These work to an increasing extent exclusively with fetishized categories without ever being able to reach the point where they can deal with the relations between men (and their relations with nature as mediated by these categories). Parallel to this development, and in great measure in consequence of it, economics has lost its place as the basic science of society and has become just one among many highly specialized sciences. Now since philosophy for the most

part has also taken this road towards increased specialization it can easily be understood why it has not occurred to the philosophers to prof it methodologically from a special study of the development of economic

categories.

We repeat: the economists of former times had a very different approach to these matters. Galiani wrote, 'Value is a relation between persons'. And as late as the break-up of the school of Ricardo this theme was still very consciously emphasized, e.g. by Thomas Hodgskin. Important as this insight is, it remains only a half-truth. When citing the above,

quoted words of Galiani Marx observed:

'He should have added "a relation concealed behind the husk of things"'.

And he went on to say:

'In other words, Hodgskin says that the effects of a certain social form of labour are ascribed to objects, to the products of labour; the relationship itself is imagined to exist in material form. We have already seen that this is a characteristic of labour based on commodity production, on exchange-value, and that this quidpro quo is revealed in the commodity, in money (Hodgskin does not see this), and, to a still higher degree, in capital. The effects of things as materialized aspects of the labour process are attributed to them in capital, in their personification, their independence in respect of labour. They would cease to have these effects if they were to cease to confront labour in this alienated form. The capitalist, as capitalist, "is simply the personification of capital, that creation of labour endowed with its own will and personality which stands in opposition to labour. Hodgskin regards this as a purely subjective illusion behind which lurks deception and the interests of the exploiting classes. He does not see that the mode of perception itself springs from the actual relationship; the latter is not the expression of the former, but vice versa' .1

With this we find ourselves in the very centre of the interaction between the categories of philosophy and economics: the dialectical categories of the social sciences appear as intellectual reflections of the dialectical process being enacted objectively, in the lives of men, but independently of their will and their knowledge and this objectivity turns social reality into a 'second nature'. On further reflection we perceive that, rightly seen, it is in this very dialectic of economics that the most primary, fundamental and crucial relations between men find expression, and that here is the vantage-point from which the dialectics of society can be studied in their pure form. Hence it is surely no accident that the birth of dialectical materialism——as an epistemology--- oincided with the discovery of this dialectic in economic life. Friedrich Engels' magisterial outline of economic categories in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbiicher and the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of Marx clearly mark this new departure. Nor is it a mere matter of chance that this last work prof fers an analysis both of the dialectical nature of the views of the classical economists and of the economic bases of Hegel's The Phenomenology f Mind.

As the reader will observe, Marx's arguments here have been a decisive influence on the present work. But if we have discussed them at some length this is because we believe that they open doors to a fruitful development of the methods of the history of philosophy. Our studies concern themselves with the interrelations between the development of Hegel's views on economics and his purely philosophical dialectics, and it is our hope that with the aid of this novel point of view we may have succeeded in discovering new patterns or correcting current ones.

But is this approach to be confined to Hegel? Is he the only thinker in whose work economics has exerted such a powerful influence? Every connoisseur of English philosophy will at once reply in the negative. He will know of the links between Locke and Petty; he will know that Locke, Berkeley and Hume were also economists, that Adam Smith was also a philosopher, and that Mandeville's views on society are inseparable from his insights into economics, and so on. At the same time, however, he will be no less aware that the methodological connections between, say, Locke's economics and his theory of knowledge are terra incognita and that up to now scholars have limited themselves to the biographical observation that economics and philosophy have become united in this one man and they have then gone on to treat the two spheres of activity independently.

Needless to say, such connections are not limited to English philosophy. Ever since Plato and Aristotle, indeed as far back as Heraclitus, there has scarcely been a single universal thinker who has ignored such problems entirely.Of course, this does not mean that every thinker who has concerned himself with those relations between men which in the

modern age have become the proper province of economics has necessarily conceived of them in terms of specif ically economic problems: it

suffices if he has found them problematical in one form or another.

Here, so I believe, we have an extraordinarily rich new field for the history of philosophy. I accordingly bring these remarks to a close with the hope that this field will soon be vigorously cultivated and that the present attempt to discover such interconnections will soon be super

seded by other, more comprehensive studies

## PART I

Hegel's Early Republican Phase (Berne 1793 — 1796)

### CHAPTER 1 Hegel's 'theological' period: a reactionary legend

The starting-point of Hegel's development, like that of almost every major figure in Germany at the time, was the Enlightenment. Here too we find ourselves confronted by a very large and largely unexplored aspect of the history of philosophy. For many years German historians of literature and philosophy were at pains to erect a Wall of China between the Enlightenment and the age of Classicism. In a wholly mistaken manner even the Sturm und Drang was set up as diametrically opposed to the Enlightenment. In more recent years, however, historians have come to enlist the Enlightenment itself in the service of reactionary apologetics and they were joined in this by scholars who began to use the Enlightenment so interpreted so as more easily to recast the important representatives of Classicism in the same reactionary mould.

A Marxist history of philosophy will be eager to look a little more closely at the class character of the German Enlightenment as well as the impact of the French and English Enlightenment on Germany. It will have to discover the dominant class antagonisms within the German Enlightenment. For it is immediately apparent that the ideology of the Enlightenment was made to serve the interests both of the feudal absolutism of the petty states and of the bourgeoisie preparing itself ideologically for revolution. Marx has already drawn attention to this dichotomy within the Enlightenment in The German Ideology. France was much more advanced and its classes were in consequence much more sharply differentiated; its class struggles had a greater clarity and definition. This meant that the important members of the Enlightenment were the natural ideologists of the approaching bourgeois revolution. Since there was no real prospect of a bourgeois revolution m Germany the influence of the French Enlightenment was correspondingly less clear-cut and unam-bivalent than in France itself.

Feudal absolutism and its ideologists have of ten endeavoured to turn certain aspects of the Enlightenment to their own purposes. Opposition to this on the part of the Gerean Enlightenment, and socio-political opposition in particular, was, by contrast, much feebler than it would have been in a more developed economy. And this feature of the German Enlightenment is reflected in every sphere of ideology. Whereas the French tended to an ever more definite form of materialism with Diderot, Holbach and Helvetius, the German Enlighteners were dominated by nothing more bold than the idea of a 'religion of reason'. In Germany atheists and materialists were the exception; for the most part they were isolated outsiders (like J. Ch. Edelmann) .1 The limits of the radicalism of the vanguard of German Enlightenment were set by a Spinozistic pantheism. And even this, if made public, as in the case of the ageing Lessing or the young Goethe, was sufficient to arouse panic and cries of horror in the ranks of the average German Enlighteners. It is very characteristic that Lessing concealed his Spinozistic views from his close friend Moses Mendelssonn and that the latter was deeply scandalized when, after Lessing's death, his Spinozism became public knowledge with the publication of an account of his conversation with F. H.Jacobi.

The scope of the present study forbids a complete analysis of the German Enlightenment proper. It must suffice for our purposes to point out that the education received by Hegel in the Tubingen Seminary consisted of an Enlightenment adapted to aristocratic, courtly needs. We now have a series of notes (recently published by Hof fmeister) which make it perfectly clear that Hegel had a very intimate and comprehensive knowledge of the literature of the German, English and French Enlightenment. The later Berne essays also show him to have made a thorough study of the Enlightenment, one which extended beyond philosophy ana historiography and included also imaginative literature. (Thus the Berne notes quote from one of Marivaux' novels.) His staple reading matter consisted initially of the German Enlighteners. In the Tubingen Notes already referred to we find an almost completTitally of the writers, of the German Enlightenment, even the minor ones, and they are not merely listed, but also treated in greater or lesser detail. Especially at the start of his stay in Berne he constantly comes back to Mendelssohn's then famous Jerusalem. Lessing's writings, in particular Nathan the Wise, are especially prominent.

But this is by no means the end of Hegel's reading-list in Tubingen.

From his notes and studies we can see very clearly that he had a very thorough knowledge of the chief figures of the French Enlightenment: Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, Holbach, Rousseau and others. We see also from the notes that he had closely studied the works of Hugo Gro-tius, Raynal's2 Indian History, Home's History of England, Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, ne had read Schiller's historical writings, a number of essays by Benjamin Constant and the works of the German revolutionary, Georg Forster.3 It goes without saying that, given the orientation of education at that time, Hegel was thoroughly familiar with the philosophers and historians of antiquity. And-- as wenshall show in detail——the young Hegel already regarded the Greek polis not as a social phenomenon of the past that came into being and fell into decay as the result of definite concrete conditions, but as the eternal model, the unsurpassed paradigm for a contemporary revolution of state and society.

This is enough to suggest the main direction of Hegel's early reading very clearly. In the internal debates affecting the entire German Enlightenment Hegel finds himself increasingly on the democratic left-wing, criticizing and opposing those elements of the Enlightenment which came into being in the course of attempts to adapt the movement to the absolutism of the petty German princes. His development from Tubingen to Berne indicates a shif t in which the English and French Enlightenment gradually displace German writers. And in so far as he does have recourse to German writers, these tend increasingly to belong to the radical wing of the German Enlightenment. It is both striking and signif icant how frequently at this time Hegel refers to what was for the Germany of the penod the very radical criticism of religion in Lessing's Nathan the Wise. It is no less striking and typical that his comparison between the Ancients and the Moderns, specif ically between classical art and Christian art, is based on views formulated in Georg Forster's Views from the Lower Rhine. Hegel made detailed excerpts from this work and it is very revealing of the outlook of his modern publishers that Hermann Nohl, although compelled to admit the existence of these excerpts, declined to reprint them in his book, thus making it difficult for the modern reader to realize their importance for Hegel s development.

We shall have later to concern ourselves with the striking fact that in his youth Hegel was on the whole indifferent to philosophical problems in the strict sense. He did indeed read the ancient philosophers and Kant and Spinoza, but the only work by the latter which is attested with certainty is his Theologico-Political Tractatus. The study of this work may well have been connected with his interest in the history and criticism of theology.

In this connection we must refer to Hegel's reading of Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History;4 for all modern editors and commentators attach enormous importance to his preoccupation with religion and theology. We shall discuss this question in detail later on. It is enough here if we point out that many of the works of the Enlightenment already alluded to also deal with religion and especially with Christianity. And whereas Hegel only makes excerpts of a factual nature from Mosheim, his notes on Gibbon, Forster, etc., show him coming down very definitely against Christianity. Nor is the fact that Hegel is also said to have shown interest in the German mystics (Meister Ecknart, Tauler, etc.) of any assistance to the constructions of Dilthey, Nohl and Co. For, as we shall see later on, the existence of Christian sects is of prime importance for Hegel's view of Christianity as a whole at this time. Just as he uncovered and criticized the sectarian nature of primitive Christianity, so too he will have had an historical and polemical interest in the problem of later sects.

However, to return to the question of his reading in philosophy, it is clear that pride of place belongs to Kant whom he must certainly have read at Tiibingen. What is of importance, however, for the state of philosophy at the time and for the mood of the younger generation of philosophers, is that both Hegel and Schelling focused their attention on The Critique of Practical Reason, Hegel more so than Schelling. From the Berne period there is not a single remark that would suggest more than a superficial interest in the problems of The Critique of Pure Reason and with epistemology in the narrower sense. Furthermore, from his correspondence with Schelling we can see that it was only hesitantly and without any great sense of urgency that Hegel read the first works of Fichte, and when he did so he evidently reacted very critically. By contrast, it is very characteristic that he felt inspired by Schiller's Letters on Aesthetic Education. And typically, as one would expect from his own views at the time, this was due not so much to his sympathy with their aesthetic and philosophical content as with their attacks on the modern collapse of culture, and their comparison of modern decadence with the grandeur of classical culture.

Of course, all this does not mean simply that Hegel's world-view can be equated with that of the Enlightenment. Not even of the German Enlightenment. A rapprochement with the French and English Enlightenment was precluded by the fact that right from the start his point of view was that of idealism. Hegel, unlike many of his distinguished contemporaries, never had any leanings towards philosophical materialism. Lenin, in the Empiriocriticism, has noted such leanings in Kant; and in all the early works of Schiller, at the time of his medical studies, we can also observe definite tendencies towards materialism. Similarly, in our portrayal of Hegel'sJena period, we shall document how powerfully Scnel-ling tended at moments towards materialism in the course of his work on natural philosophy. Hegel is much more consistent than these thinkers and remained a steadfast idealist throughout his life.Even the sporadic signs of materialism which Lenin detects in the Logic are part of his detour through objective idealism, through the encyclopaedic length and breadth of his knowledge and his sober, unprejudiced respect for facts. His conscious philosophical thought, however, was always that of an idealist.

We have already asserted that in Tiibingen and Berne Hegel did not concern himself with philosophical problems in any intensive manner and that at no time did ne become involved with problems in the theory of knowledge. Nevertheless, we can observe the emergence of a unif ied view of social and historical phenomena. At the same time there is little evidence of any sustained preoccupation with the problems of natural philosophy in Berne. Hegel does not attempt to analyse philosophically the premises of his coherent viewpoint. Like many of his contemporaries nis aim is to apply Kant's analysis in The Critique of Practical Reason to

history and society. The Kantian influence takes two predominant forms: on the one hand, Hegel regards social problems primarily as problems of morality; on the other hand, the problem of pra is, i.e. the transformation of social reality by man himself, remains the constant focus of his thought.

However, on one crucial matter, Hegel, from very early on, went beyond Kant. Kant had investigated moral problems from the standpoint of the individual. In his view conscience was the fundamental moral fact.

And if he seemed to be able to establish his idealism in objective reality, he could do so only by projecting the common features, the universal validity of the ethics he was attempting to discover into a fictitious apparently more than individual, but in reality mystif ied individual subject: the so-called 'intelligible self. In Kant social problems are secondary, deriving from the subsequent interactions of the primary reality, namely the individual subjects.

In contrast to this, Hegel's early subjectivism has a practical bent which is social and collective right from the start. For Hegel activity, social praxis, was always both the starting-point and the central object of thought. This implies a methodology which has definite points of contact with Herder. Herder was the first thinker of the German Enlightenment to raise the question of the nature of collective social praxis —even though he was never able to arrive at a clear conceptual definition of the nature of the acting subject and the real laws governing his actions; above all on questions of method he leaves matters in an impenetrable half-light. It cannot be proven that Hegel was influenced by Herder's ideas at any given point, indeed there is nothing in the records to suggest that he was ever particularly impressed by Herder. Despite this, Herder's ideas were in tne air at the time and it would be futile to seek for specif ic parallels in his work and in Hegel's early writings.

Crucial, however, for the entire development of Hegel is the fact that he proceeds from Herder's unclarif i.ed concept of the collective subject. In his Berne period he makes no attempt to clarif y this concept epistemologically. He seeks instead to trace the fortunes of this collective subject, its deeds and its fate in the course of history, of the transformation of social reality. We shall see that the central theme of this process is the fragmentation of the collective subject into 'private individuals' of which society henceforth will be the mere Aggregate*.

As we shall see, Hegel in his Berne period simply noted this fragmentation as an historical tact, without drawing any elaborate philosophical conclusions from it. His chief preoccupation at this time was practical: how was it possible for the collective subjectivity of the city-states of antiquity to fall into decay in the first place? This was the question that agitated him and it signals the appearance in his thought of the intellectual reflection of the world-historical illusions that guided the actions of Robespierre, St. Just and the other Jacobin leaders of the French Revolution. Only after the defeat of Jacobinism, only after Thermidor, in the midst of the philosophical crisis that overwhelmed him in FrankfUrt did he come to tnink of modern bourgeois society and the 'private' individual in more favourable terms. And we shall see how the twin themes of political economy and a dialectical view of society began to preoccupy his mind as a result of that crisis.

For the moment, however, we are concerned with this conceptually unanalysed collective subject of history. And we know too that Hegel gave a moral slant to all the social and historical problems that confronted him. It follows inevitably that in these debates religion must have played a decisive role. Here we have one of the points which the reactionary philosophy of the Age of Imperialism could turn to good account in its falsif ication of Hegel. It is very symptomatic that Hermann Nohl entitled his edition of the Berne and Frankfurt fragments Hegel's Early Theological Writings. This was meant to suggest to the reader that Hegel's interest in theology in the Tiibingen seminary went beyond the need to earn his bread and butter, and that theological problems constituted the foundation and the starting-point of his entire thought. This insinuation is made even more explicit by Hegel's other modern editor, Georg Lasson. In his eyes religion and theology are the central axis around which the whole Hegelian system revolves; he attacks every critic, however reactionary, who omits to put religion in the very centre of his interpretation of Hegel. In this context it is relevant to consider the basic thesis of the chief modern biographer of the young Hegel, Th. L. Haering, who regards Hegel as a 'teacher of his nation' in the sense that he re-interprets the practical starting-point we have been discussing in terms of an attempt to impart religious instruction to the people.

What is the truth about the 'theological' character of Hegel's youthful works? The unprejudiced and attentive reader will find precious little to do with theology in them, indeed as far as theology is concerned the tone is one oisustained hostility. Of course, we have already agreed that the religious problem occupies an important place in his historical analyses, and it never ceases to do so, as we can see from his mature philosophy.

We need to ask two questions about this. First, what is the nature of his concern with religion in this early phase? Second, what is the historical foundation underlying this concern, what are its historical conditions and determinants? Turning to the second question first we must at once point out that the question of the historical content and the historical efficacy of the religions, and especially of Christianity, had formed one of the perennial themes o广 the entire German Enlightenment up to Reimarus5 and Lessing. And we must add that the problem continues to appear right up to the time of the dissolution of Hegelianism in the writmgs of Strauss, Bruno Bauer and Feuerbach. Thus by asking such questions Hegel positions himself in the mainstream of the German Enlightenment. Engels has discovered the real reasons for this phenomenon in Feuerbach:

At that time, however, politics was a very thorny field and hence the main fight came to be directed against religion; this fight, particularly after I 840, was indirectly also political. *

This indirect political quality inherent in religion and the attack on religion existed to the same extent in the period of Hegel's Early Theological Writings. Indeed, whereas in the period of preparation leading up to the revolution of I 848 philosophical radicalism soon came to dismiss the criticism of theology as a half-measure, as an inadequate form of ideological opposition, any serious attempt to criticize theology in the German Enlightenment of the eighteenth century was inevitably felt, given the badcward conditions of the time, to have a far greater revolutionary force. This is the proper context in which to appraise Hegel's Early Theological Writings. Their main thrust is directed against the Christian religion. We noted earlier that the pillar of Hegel's view of the philosophy of history at this period was the notion that the collapse of the city-states of antiquity meant the disappearance of the society of human freedom and greatness and the transformation of the heroic, republican citoyen of the polis into the bourgeois, the merely egoistic 'private individual' of modern society. We may anticipate our analysis of Hegel's discussion of Christianity in this penod and give our conclusion which is that in his youth Hegel conceives of Christianity as the religion of the 'private individual', of the bourgeois, as the religion of the loss of human liberty, of the millennia-long despotism and enslavement of mankind. Such ideas place Hegel firmly in the mainstream of Enlightenment thought.

This conclusion stands in need of the qualif ying remark that Hegel, like the German Enlightenment, never took his attacks on Christianity as far as the great English and French thinkers. His critique of Christiamty never reaches the point of materialist atheism. Quite the reverse, the core of his work here is religious. His aim is to discover the social prerequisites for a return from the religion of despotism and enslavement to a religion of freedom on the model of antiquity.

In the German context there is nothing surprising about his. Engels observed that even Feuerbach's attack on religion and his unmasking of religion occasionally turns into a demand for a new, 'purif ied' faith. And Engels shows further that the overestimation of the historical importance of religion, the belief that the great turning-points of history are determined by religious changes, continues to colour Feuerbach's view of history. All this applies with even greater truth to the German Enlightenment before Hegel. We need only think of a man of Lessing's importance and integrity and remind ourselves that his struggles for Enlightenment never broke through the framework of religion. On the other hand, we must not overstate the matter: if it is true that the German Enlightenment never reached the resolute materialism and atheism of Diderot, Helvetius or Holbach, it is no less true that it went beyond them at certain points in its historical understanding of the origins of religion and the social roots of religious change. (This applies above all to Lessing and Herder.)

It is here that we have to look for the importance of Hegel's early writings. Hegel poses the very radical question of the social reasons for the rise of Christianity and places this in the very centre of his work. With that idealist overestimation of the role of religion in history, of which we have just spoken, he sees Christianity as the ultimately decisive cause of all the social and political events of the modern world which excite his greatest animosity. His chief practical aim, the revival of the democracy of the polis with all its freedom and greatness, stood in need of historical foundations, of an historical underpinning: he had to chart those social movements, that social and political decline, which led to the predominance of the Christian religion. His goal is to do away with the entire complex tradition: he researches into the causes of its origins in order to plot the trajectory of its decline and fall.

We can see from this how all these early views of Hegel's reflect the influence of the French Revolution. His early enthusiasm for the French Revolution is not in dispute. It is well known that while still boys in Tubingen the three friends Hegel, Holderlin and Schelling planted a tree of liberty and danced around it singing revolutionary songs. There is likewise a tradition according to which they were the centre of a secret society devoted to the reading of forbidden writings about the French Revolution. Their enthusiasm was part of a more general mood that prevailed among the best members of the German intelligentsia of the day about whom we have spoken in earlier studies. We pointed out there that in many cases this enthusiasm was short-lived. Only very few contemporary German intellectuals were able to understand and make a just appraisal of the events of 1793/4. The majority were shocked and repelled by the plebeian dictatorship of the Paris Jacobins (Klopstock and Schiller were typical of many). Of course, it is one or the legends of bourgeois historians that their disappointment led them to become the confirmed enemies of the French Revolution in general and that they thenceforth renounced the principles of 1789. In most cases the truth is the very opposite of this and nowhere more so than with Hegel.

In a letter to Schelling at Christmas 1 794 Hegel wrote:

'You will have heard that Carriere has gone to the guillotine. Do you still read French newspapers? If I remember rightly I have heard that they have been banned in Wiirttemberg. This trial is very important and has uncovered the perfidious nature of the Robespierrites.'7

This letter shows very clearly that even in his youth Hegel was hostile to Jacobinism. Hegel's special position among his German contemporaries does not lie in his political radicalism. Not only Forster went a lot further on this issue—in his life as well as in theory——the same is true of Fichte; and older members of the Enlightenment such as Wieland or Herder, retained feelings of sympathy even for the extremist aspects of the Revolution for a much longer time. The outstanding feature of Hegel's position was that even though he rejected the extreme left wing oi the Revolution right from the beginning, he nevertheless retained his faith in its historical necessity and to the very end of his life he regarded it as the very foundation of modern civil society.

Of course, Hegel's view of modern civil society undergoes a number of radical changes. In Berne, despite his rejection of Robespierre's policies, Hegel still sees the Revolution as the foundation of the approaching renewal of society. Later, after his Frankfurt crisis, when he has deepened his knowledge of the economic nature of modern society, he no longer regards the Revolution as the impulse, the vehicle for a future renewal of society, but rather as the historically past, if historically necessary foundation of reality as it is in the contemporary world.This inspires in him an admittedly somewhat tempered enthusiasm even for the radical sides of the Revolution.

We shall later follow Hq^efs development with the aid of his own statements through to the famous chapter (on Absolute Freedom and Terror) in The Phenomenology of Mind. For the present it is enough to acquaint ourselves more fully with Hegel's mood at the time. In a somewhat later letter to Schelling he writes ( 16 April 1795):

'I think that there is no better sign of our time than the fact that mankind portrays itself as being so worthy of respect. It is a proof that the aura surrounding the oppressors and the gods of this earth is fading. The philosopher will demonstrate this dignity and the peoples will learn to feel and not merely to demand the rights that have oeen so Sampled under foot, but to receive them and take possession of them themselves. Religion and politics have conspired together. The former has taught what the latter wanted: contempt for mankind, man's inability to achieve good, to become something through his own efforts. With the propagation of the idea of how things should be, the indolence of people settled in their ways, their willingness to accept everything as it is for evermore, will disappear. 'I

This letter is interesting in a number of ways. In the fi.rst place, it shows the extent to which Hegel's premises derive from the Critique of Practical Reason. Qmte in contrast to nis later views where he insists on reality as the starting pomt and rejects the abstract Kantian 'Ought' as a foundation of social science, Hegel here follows Kant by opposing the revolutionary 'Ought' to the reactionary inertia of 'Is'. At the same time, however, he boldly re-interprets Kant without concerning himself too much about epistemological legitimations. The 'Ought here has a purely political and social meaning, its moral character forms only the ,

general idealist backcloth. Moreover, the antithesis between Is and Ought does not reside within the individual psyche as a contrast between the empirical and the intelligible self, as in Kant, It is an antithesis between progressive and reactionary tendencies in politics and society itself.

As to the socio-political content of the letter, it is evident that Hegel's struggle against the dominant forms of philosophy and religion was the ideological aspect of his struggle against despotism in general. Inasmuch as he regarded the critique of Christianity as a component of the general struggle against the despotism of feudal absolutism he placed himself alongside the Enlightenment and above all the great class struggles which ce'itred on religion during the French Revolution. Engels very rightly emphasizes the fact that, unlike all previous bourgeois revolutions, a distinguishing feature of the French Revolution was its irreligious nature. Whereas earlier bourgeois revolutions, including the English Revolution of the seventeenth century, were fought under the banner of religion, the French Revolution

'appealed exclusively to juristic and political ideas, and troubled itself about religion only in so far as it stood in its way. But it never occurred to it to put a new religion in place of the old. Everyone knows how Robespierre failed in his attempt. '9

With these words Engels accurately sums up the main line of the French Revolution. However, if we turn to Hegel's relationship to these events we must remind ourselves of our earlier arguments about the distorted reflection of the revolution in Germany arising from the country's economic and political backwardness. For, even though the leading politicians of the French Revolution were impeded by all sorts of prejudices and illusions (partly of a religious nature), they nevertheless approached the issue as thinking politicians. The relation of the revolutionary state to Catholicism was determmed in reality by two factors. On the one hand, the Catholic church was an ideological and organizational centre of the royalist counter-revolution. On the other hand, the leading politicians saw or, at any rate, felt that the influence of Catholicism on the mass of the peasantry could not simply be abolished by decree. If we examine the very chequered history of this theme in all its details we find that they fully bear out Engels' account.10

The bourgeois historians of the religious movements during the Revolution are united on one point: they all vastly over-estimate their real signif icance. Thus Mathiez, for instance, places too much emphasis on the connections between the Babeuf conspiracy and the Theophilanth-ropists, even though from his own account it is very clear that Babeuf ,

and his colleagues only made use of the religious and moral meetmgs of this sect to acquire a reasonably secure legality for their own meetings.” And from the information contained in Aulard and Mathiez it is quite obvious that the struggle of Danton and Robespierre agamst the religious views of Hebert and Chaumette, etc., was dictated by purely political considerations, namely the fear that the extremist agitation of the latter would dnve the peasantry into the Royalist camp for good.

Indeed, even Robespierre's attempt, in the last phase of his rule, to found a new religion, the cult of the 'Supreme Being' was primarily a political and not a religious action, even though it was the action of a desperate politician in an objectively desperate situation. And this remains true despite its being coloured by Robespierre's Rousscauistic views, by the illusion he and his followers entertained about the perspectives and possibilities of the democratic bourgeois revolution. In the emphasis on morality which came for Robespierre to occupy the centre of the stage of theJacobin revolutionary Terror, we see the reflection of his desperate struggle against the capitalist tendencies unleashed by the Revolution which were pushing the whole movement towards the liquidation of the plebeian dictatorship of the Jacobins, towards the open, unashamed dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, towards Thermidor. Terror in the name of republican virtue, the struggle agamst all forms of moral perversion and corruption was in Robespierre's case the ideological aspect of the defence of the plebeian vemon of the democratic, bourgeois revolution against both the royalist counter-revoluuon and even agamst the bourgemsie itself. The fact that Robespierre's policy was based on illusion and that the Jacobin dictatorship simply had to collapse once it had carried out its task of saving the Revolution from foreign invasion by mobilizing the masses, does not detract in the least from the political character of Robespierre's actions in his last phase, even on the issue of religion.

Thus when Robespierre in his speech to the Convention of 5 February 179412 proclaimed that a moral counter-revolution, was being made which would prepare the way for a political counter-revolution, he was absolutely in the right from his point of view一- iscounting the necessary illusions, of course. And his endeavours to found a new religion, viz.the cult of a Supreme Being, were based on the need for a broad base in the moral attitudes of the people which would help to secure and further the revolution; what he; needed was a counterweight both to the agitation of the Church and to the demoralizing and corrupting acts of the bourgeoisie.13 Amid the fluctuations of the class struggles after Ther-midor we witness the emergence of a number of sects which similarly attempted to prop up the spirit of republicanism by exerting a religious and moral influence over the masses. The 'Theophilanthropists' were the most important of them. This sect consisted chiefly of moderate republicans and for a time it had a certain influence over individual republican-minded members of the Directory. Its premise was the belief that the old religions were unsuited to the task of erecting a system of republican ethics and that without such a moral reform the republic would be deprived of any roots in the masses, in the morality of the people.

Robespierre had already come to regard the great popular festivals the republican customs of celebrating the salient events in daily life (birth, marriage, burial) as important instruments in the religious and moral edif ication of the people. In the speech to the Convention already cited he spoke at length of the signif icance of popular festivals among the Greeks, in particular of the important role assigned to the independent activity of the people. He concludes that all this could be revived in France on a much greater scale:

'A system of such festivals would constitute the gentlest bond of fraternity and the most potent instrument of regeneration.n4

Naturally enough, these somewhat external means of 'religious revival' played a much greater part in the sectarianism after Thermidor than in the actions of a politician like Robespierre.

We have already argued that historians like Aulard and Mathiez attached far too much importance to these religious movements. From our point of view, however, it is less important to consider the signif icance of these movements in France itself than to see how they were received in the retrograde society of Germany, and above all how they affected Hegel.

We have no direct proof that Hegel concerned himself to any great extent with these religious phenomena. Nevertheless, it is extremely probable that he was acquainted with them. Mathiez35 gives a detailed bibliography of the journals which published articles for or against the Theophilanthropists. Among these we find Wieland's l eutsche Mercur, one of the most widely read periodicals, as well as the Minerva of Archenholz. We have precise knowledge that Hegel both knew and read the latter publication.^ Since we also know that in Switzerland he followed a large variety of French journals it would be extremely surprising, in view of his interest in the religious and moral regeneration of mankind, if he had no no knowledge of the French religious movements at all.

But of greater weight than these circumstantial arguments is the internal evidence. In the course of our discussion of Hegel's views on antiquity in the following chapters we shall talk at length of the great importance he attached to the popular festivals of Greece and the active participation of the people in Greek religious rites. His attitudes here come very close to those of Robespierre in the speech from which we have already quoted. And as for the general elevation of morals with the aid of a new religion to be based on a regeneration of antiquity, it is evident that this lay at the heart of his interests at this time.

Like most German idealists Hegel regarded the moral regeneration of the people less as the product than as the prerequisite of revolution. Schiller had already put forward a similar view m the Aesthetic Letters which, as we have seen, made a great impression on Hegel. Schiller's attitude, however, is pessimistic.Just because he held the moral regeneration of the people to be the indispensable prerequisite of a successful revoluuon, he despaired that the latter would ever come about, even though he thought of the abolition of feudal absolutism as an historical and moral necessity. Even so it is noteworthy that Schiller dismissed the idea that the state could bring about the regeneration of the people through education.

The young Hegel parts company with Schiller here since he is much more sanguine about the prospects for the regeneration of mankind and the onset of a revolutionary period in which humanity and freedom celebrate their rebirth. It is for this reason that religion plays such a major role in his early idealism. Still within the framework of Kant's ethics and social theory, he realizes that the state can do no more than compel its citizens to obey the law: it can enforce legality but not morality. But since he also believes that the stability of a government depends on its roots in the moral principles of the people he casts around him in history to discover the factors that determine these moral principles. And he finds in religion the most efficacious of all such factors. Thus in "/ ' he Positivity of the Christian Religion, his most important treatise from the Bernc period, he has this to say about the relations between the state and its citizens:

'The state can only induce its citizens to make use of these institutions by inspiring confidence in them. Religion is the pre-eminent instrument for mis purpose, and whether or not it can fulfil this task depends on the use made of it by the state.This purpose is clearly in evidence in the religions of all people. One thing they all have in common is that they all aspire to create that moral climate which no application of civil laws can bring about ...'"

Here, we believe, the character of Hegel's early writings is plain for all to see. He believes that what he regards as the crucial turning-points of D                          D 1

history, namely the transition from Greek freedom to medieval and modern despotism, and the hoped-for transition from this despotism to a new freedom, are intimately connected with religious movements. Both democracy and despotism require religions adapted to their needs if they are to survive. And it is apparent from what we have said already that the way in which Hegel poses the question of a religion of the fUture and its role in the revival of classical antiquity has very close parallels with the illusions of the French revolutionaries and with religious and moral aspirations within the Revolution. One of the inevitable consequences of Hegel's Germanness was that in his youth he reacted so powerfully to the least signif icant aspect of the French Revolution. In our further discussions, however, we shall see that even from this remote point of view he contrives to grasp a number of the objectively central moments of the socio-historical development.

Of course, an essential part of idealism is its vast over-estimation of the historical role of religion. And this over-estimation is maintained throughout Hegel's career. As we shall see, Hegel later revised his early opinions very thoroughly on almost every important issue. But as late as his Berlin lectures on the philosophy of history, even in the midst of arguments dealing with the July Revolution of 1830, he still returns to the same problem. In the course of a diatribe against the liberalism of the countries of Western Europe he says:

'For it is a false principle which maintains that the shackles of law and freedom can be cast of f without a liberation of conscience, or that there can be a revolution without a reformation.nB

It is evident that Hegel's youthful assumption of the historical efficacy of religion accompanied him——admittedly with great modif ications of substance——throughout his life. This is the heritage of philosophical idealism that he never shook of f But for all that the belief in Hegel's 'theological' early period remains a legend created and fostered by the reactionary apologists of imperialism.

### CHAPTER 2 What is the meaning of 'positivity' in Hegel's early works?

The real issue of central importance in the works of Hegel's Berne period was that of 'positive' religion, especially of 'positive' Christianity. To present our conclusions first, we must assert that the heart of the matter is that for Hegel the positive religion of Christianity was a pillar of despotism and oppression, whereas the non-positive religions of antiquity were religions of freedom and human dignity. To revive these was the revolutionary challenge facing his generation.

We must begin by clarifying Hegel's conception of positivity. He employs the concept in a number of places in his Berne writings and, in what follows, we snail allow Hegel to state the matter as far as possible in his own words.

'A positive faith is a system of religious propositions which are true for us because they have been presented to us by an authority which we cannot flout. In the first instance the concept implies a system of religious propositions or truths which must be held to be truths independently of our own opinions, and which even if no man has ever perceived them and even if no man has ever considered them to be truths, nevertheless remain truths. These truths are of ten said to be objective truths and what is required of them is that they should now become subjective truths, truths for us. 'I

The main point here is the independence of such propositions together with the demand that the subject should regard them as binding on himself even though he has not created them. Positivity, then, means primarily the suspension of the moral autonomy of the subject. To this extent it seems very close to Kantian ethics and does in fact contain a number of similar features. However, what Hegel means by the subject is something different from Kant's moral subject; for Hegel it is something social and historical. Admittedly, its definition is extraordinarily vague and unclear. What it amounts t —inasmuch as it is more than a shorthand for the world view of the Greeks, i.e. the historical and moral ideal ——is the identity of the moral autonomy of the individual with the democratic collective embracing the entire people. The contradiction between the subjectivity of the individual and the social activity of the totality arises in Hegel's view only with the break-up of the democracy

of the polis and the intervention of the Christian religion. Thenceforth the Christian religion stands opposed to the individual as something objective, 'positive', and the need to obey its commandments is, on the one hand, a consequence of the loss of freedom and, on the other, a continuously self-reproducing process of oppression and despotism.

In Hegels view this period of despotism extends to the present day and pervades every aspect of social life and ideology. He iudges the moral degradation of men according to the degree to which they nave come to accept their loss of freedom and according to whether they solve the problems of ideology by orienting themselves towards freedom or towards submission to the positive authority. A passage from Hegel's Travel Journal Quly to August 1796)reflects his mood precisely and illustrates even more clearly the general definition of positivity given above. At around this time he made a small tour of the Bernese Oberland and observed the poverty of nature there, and the great problems facing men who were trying to wrest a living from unfavourable conditions through their own labour. As might be expected from his interests at this time, he speculates about the religion, the world view that would arise under such circumstances and comes to the following, highly charac-teristic conclusion:

'In these barren wastes cultivated men might well have invented all other theories and sciences; but one can scarcely believe that they could have thought of that part of the physico-theological argument which would demonstrate to man's pride that nature had prepared everything for his enjoyment and well-being; a pride which is characteristic of our age in which man finds more satisfaction in the contemplation of all that has been done for him by an alien being, than in the consciousness that it is he who has furnished nature with all these purposes.7

Here we see the radical subjectivity of the early Hegel very clearly. Kant, too, had attacked the crude and dogmatic arguments from design in the so-called physico-theological proof of the existence of God. But Kant's method had been to demonstrate the internal contradictions in such teleological views by showing the antinomies which spring from them. None of this interests Hegel. He is fascinated by the question of what sort of man is attracted by the physico-theological Eroof what sort of man will reject it. Is a man proud of what he has made imsel£ or does he derive pleasure from the belief that an alien power (God) cares for him? Thus Hegel aims to purge morality of all theological—positive— lements, but unlike Kant, he does not do this because the objects of theology are unknowable, but because he holds faith to be incompatible with freedom and the dignity of man. Thus Hegel energetically repudiates the process by which Kant, who had dissolved theological entities in J 'he Critique of Pure Reason, decla ring them to be unknowable, later reinstated the very same entities, with the aid of the 'postulates of practiCal reason' and restored them to their place in his view of life.3

In this struggle against the revival of theology with the aid of Kamian ethics Hegel was not alone, his views were snared by his young friend Schelling. In a letter of 1795 Schelling complams to Hegel that m Tiibingen, where he was studying, The Critique of Practical Reason had infused new life into reactionary, orthodox theology.

'Every dogma imaginable has been converted into a postulate of practical reason and where the theoretical and historical proof s are wanting, the practical reason (d la Tiibingen) simply cuts the Gordian knot. It is blissful to be able to witness the triumph of these heroes of philosophy. The lean years of philosophy that have been foretold, are now a thing of the past! >4

In this battle Schelling based himself to a considerable degree on the philosophy of Fichte.

Hegel was wholly in accord with Schellmg in his attack on this new Kantian theology. His reply, however, contains a number of very characteristic features on which we must dwell a little. Above all he shows very little interest in the strictly philosophical problems involved. At the same time he is revealed to be highly critical of Fichte. Having expressed his agreement with Schelling, he goes on:

'It is undeniable that Fichte, with his Critique of Revelation has flung open the gate to the kind of nonsense you describe and whose last act I can easily imagine. He has made only moderate use of it himself but once his principles have become firmly established it will not be possible to stem the tide of theological logic. Starting with the sanctity of God he deduces what his moral nature impells him to do and so reintroduces the old style of dogmatic reasoning. Now that moral faith has been re-established, it would perhaps be worth the effort to discover how far we may argue backwards from the newly legitimated idea of God; e.g. whether by way of justif ying teleological arguments we may proceed from ethical theology to physico-theology and there hold sway unopposed. '5

Looking back to the earlier passage on the physico-theological proof it is clear that Hegel makes a much more thorough-going attempt than any of his contemporaries to liberate Kant's practical reason, the moral autonomy of man, from all elements of theology; and that he regards all the efforts of Kant and Fichte in this direction as no more than a continuation of Christian positivity in a new guise.

His reply to Schelling contains yet another passage of such absorbing interest that wt" cannot forbear to quote it. Even though he remams fairly indifferent to the epistemological implications of positive relig10n and theology, he goes right to the heart of the social foundauons of the debate and gives a very blunt, naturalist view of the social underpinning of this theological renaissance:

'What you tell me of the -si Diis placet- theological, Kantian trends in philosophy in Tubingen is not at all surprising. Orthodoxy will never be budged as long as it is bound up with worldly advantage and so closely intertwined with the state as a whole. This interest is too poweful to be easily surrendered and it has its effect without our ever quite realizing how widespread it is.'6

We can see from this that Hegel has a much larger and more social understanding of the concept of the practical than aid Kant, Fichte and even the early Schelling. Hegel does, it is true, make Kant's practical concept of freedom the philosophical premise of his own demands for freedom and human dignity, but his idea of how to realize these demands is at once transferred to the social plane. And at this penod he is not in the least concerned about the difficulties of combinmg this subjecuve, idealist premise with the real social and historical conclusions he draws from it. It is well known that, later on, Hegel both severely criticized the subjective nature of Kant's ethics and attempted to resolve the social problems implicit in this ethics on the basis of objective idealism, of an idealist dialectics of social development.

In Berne, however, Hegel attempts an interesting socio-historical extension of the dualism of Kant and Fichte, which for him too necessarily arises from a subjective, idealist view of the nature of morality. Kant held that there are two utterly separate worlds with no mediating transitions: the world of ethics, of the intelligible self (the noumenon) in which the categories of the manifest world (causality, etc.) have no validity, and the world of knowledge, of the empirical self (the phenomenon) where these categories hold sway. With his theory of the 'non-Ego' (i.e. the entire external world) posited by the 'Ego', Fichte shif ts the whole problem into the realm of general philosophy, where he converts Kant's explanation of ethics into the foundation and starting-point of the theory of knowledge. As we shall see, this view in its turn has a profound effect on the early philosophy of Schelling.

Hegel has a quite different approach to the problem of relating the free moral consciousness to objective reality. For him, too, objective reality is a 'dead', objective world of externals alien to the moral consciousness in all its living subjectivity. However, this antithesis is not 'eternal', it is no philosophical, epistemological antithesis as it is for Kant and his successors: it is instead an historical growth. It is the defining feature of the Middle Ages and the modern world. However, in the city-states of antiquity it did not exist and the idea that it could be abo lished lies at the heart of Hegel's deepest hopes fo r the fu ture. Only if we keep this in mind will we be able to grasp the full impli-cations of the crucial issue of the Berne period, namely the meaning of positive’Christianity. In Hegel's view this positivity is the actual social reality corresponding to Kant's ethical dualism. Only when we realizet his will we be able to appreciate that Hegel's indiference towards Fichte's reform of Kantianism does not spring from an antipathy towards philosophy. It is important to avoid the impression that the early Hegel had no real philosophical problems and that his biography consists of the awakening of his philosophical instincts. On the contrary, we shall see later on that most of the elements peculiar to his thought grow organically from this conception of the antithesis between positivity and moral subjectivity. But problems of epistemology only become acute for Hegel and move to the forefront of nis attention when the contradictions in his cations of the crucial issue of the Berne period, namely the meaning of 'positive' Christianity. In Hegel's view this positivity is the actual social reality corresponding to Kant's ethical dualism. Only when we realize this will we be able to appreciate that Hegel's indifference towards Fichte's reform of Kantianism does not spring from an antipathy towards philosophy. It is important to avoid the impression that the early Hegel original view appear as the objective contradictions of social reality, i.e. when epistemology becomes the dialectics of reality itself.

It is tor this reason that this alien, dead, givenness of the laws of morality is the salient characteristic of positivity. An essential part of every moral law, he insists, is that the moral subject should legislate for himself.

'The Christian religion, however, proclaims the moral law as something external to us, as something "given" and must therefore strive to win respect for it on other grounds. We may therefore regard it as a defining feature of a positive religion that it posits the moral law as something given to mankind."

This gives rise to a complex ethical casuistry within Christianity as contrasted with the free workings of an unspoilt moral sense in societies with a non-positive religion. The Christian religion possesses a code which prescribes

'partly ... what man ought to do, partly what he ought to know and believe, and partly what he ought to feel. On the possession and

manipulation of this code rests the entire legislative and judicial power of the church, and if the rights of human reason are imcompa-,tible with submission to an alien code of this sort, then the entire

power of the church, and if the rights of human reason are incompa-rights to legislate for himself and to account to himself for the management oithat law, since with that alienation he would cease to be a human being.' Here we have a clear statement of the insoluble contradiction between positive religion and human freedom. In his most important work of this period in Berne, in The Positivity of the Christian Religion from which we have already quoted, and from which we shall now cite further passages, Hegel charts this antagonism through a number of spheres of moral life and for important aspects of the problems of society. Positive religion, so depicted, is in Hegel's view the determining moment of the whole of life in the Middle Ages and modern times. Oviously its ramif ications are felt even in the realms of knowledge, the understanding and reason. According to Hegel the loss of moral freedom necessarily entails the loss of the independent use of one's reason. The alien, lifeless, given and yet dominant object of positive religion destroys the harmonious and coherent life which man had earlier enjoyed in the age of freedom; it transforms the crucial issues of life into transcendental, unknowable problems inaccessible to reason.

The emergence of such problems is likewise the consequence of positive religion in Hegel's view. Its power lies precisely in the fact that in every sphere of his thought and his being man acknowledges this alien authority; once he has renounced his moral freedom he can no longer resist the superior force of positive religion. So the tentacles of the latter reach out into every sphere of life and stifle every attempt to make free use of human reason.

'The capacity for this [positive faith] necessarily presupposes the loss of the freedom, the autonomy of one's reason which henceforth stands helpless before a superior power. This is the point at which all belief or disbelief in a positive religion begins. At the same time, it is the centre around which all disputes revolve and even if it never rises to the surface of consciousness it is nevertheless the deciding factor between submissiveness and rebellion. The orthodox must stand fast at this point and make no concessions . ..'9

This dominance extends even into the realm of knowledge. The judgment of reason concerning the so-called historical truths of religion, to say nothing of miracles, must be that they are merely products of the imagination, 'fictions', etc. Positive religion cannot tolerate this.

'Recourse must be had, therefore, to a higher faculty before which reason must fall silent. Faith is erected into a duty and removed into a supernatural world to which the understanding has no access——and in this context faith means a configuration of events presented to the imagination while the understanding constantly searches for a different explanation. And what prevents the understanding from entering this world is duty, i.e. fear of a mighty ruler which compels the understanding to collude in activities abhorrent to it. 'I0

There can be no doubt: these ostensibly theological writings are one long indictment of Christianity. Every connoisseur of the literature of the Enlightenment will have been reminded by our quotations of the wider anti-religious struggles of that age.At the same time, however, it

is important to note not only the resemblances but also the methodological differences separating Hegel and the Enlightenment. We have already stated that Hegel, unlike Diderot, Holbach or Helvetius, never ,                                            ,

attacked religion as such, but contrasted positive religion polemically with a non-positive religiosity. (In this respect he comes closest to Rousseau.) But there is a further point at which they diverge: the outstanding members of the Enlightenment, like Hegel, speak frequently of the degrading effects of Christianity, of its destruction of freedom and human dignity. But they never focus on this with the same exclusiveness as Hegel. For them it is no less important to confront the Teachings of Christianity and religion in general with the facts of reality as established by science and so to unmask the inner hollowness and the contradictions of religion.

This motif plays a very subordinate role in Hegel's early thought. As we have noted, he mentions from time to time that the dogmas of Chris-tianity are incompatible with reason and reality; however, this is of no more than passing importance for him. Even when he comes expressly to consider this question he is less disturbed by the discrepancies between

religious dogmas and the truths of science than by the immoral demands of the church that human reason should accept such dogmas untested, positively, and that they should be made the objects of faith and religiom reeling. This approach to the anti-religious struggle enables us to see just how the great writers of the French Enlightenment towered above the early Hegel. At the same time, we must admit that even though the subjectivism that led Hegel to this approach is itself the social and ideological product of the backward state of Germany, the German Enlightenment and Kantian philosophy, etc., it likewise forms the foundations for his development both of the 'active side' and the historicism of his method.

Later on in this chapter we shall have to return to the question of the foundations and consequences of Hegel's view of positivity. We were concerned here only in sketching its basic features, its chief contours, with a view to clarif ying his approach to the philosophy of history.

As we have seen, Hegel ts the advocate of the 'primacy of practical reason'. He simply equates the Absolute, the autonomous and the practical. This exclusive sovereignty of the practical reason is the feature common to his early work and that of Schelling. In the context of the relation of practical reason to theology, we have already had occasion to observe both the identity of views and the divergences between Hegel and Schelling. Since the initial philosophical friendship and the later breach between Schelling and Hegel both play an important role in the emergence of the dialectic we must necessarily acquaint the reader with his position at this period. In one of his earliest works, the New Deduction of Natural Law (Spring 1796), Schelling declares, in agreement with Fichte and in termsthatshow a definite parallel to Hegel's idea of 'positi-vity', that the Absolute, the Unconditional, can never be an object:

'As soon as I attempt to hold fast to it as an object it returns to within the confines of the contingent. Whatever is an object for me, can only appear; as soon as it becomes more than appearance, my freedom is destroyed . If l am to realize the Unconditional, it must cease to be an object for me.'

The Absolute is thus identical with the ego."

Schelling's views with all their implications emerge even more clearly m a small essay not intended for publication and of which we possess a fragment in a copy by Hegel dating from 1796. The copy begins with the section on ethics. We do not know what preceded it. Perhaps some of it has been lost; perhaps, not untypically, he copied out only this one section. Schelling declares here that the whole of philosophy (he uses the term 'metaphysics') is identical with morality, an approach first developed by Kant but by no means exhausted by him. It is a view that must lead to quite origmal conceptions of nature and the natural sciences. We see here the seeds of Schelling's later visions of natural philosophy. What concerns us, however, is his view of society and the state. Schelling has this to say on the subject:

'From nature I come to the works of man. Guided by the idea of humanity, I intend to show that there can be no idea of the state, since the state is mechanical—ust as there can be no such thing as the idea of a machine. Only that which is free can be called an idea. We must therefore transcend the state! For every state must treat free men as cogs in a machine; and this must be prevented. Hence the state must cease to exist.'

Proceeding from these considerations Schelling goes on to set out the principles for a history of mankind 'and to expose the entire wretched notch-potch of the state, constitution, government and legislature.' This is to be followed by his ideas about morality and religion.

'The destruction of all false gods, the persecution of the priesthood with their new hypocritical adoption of reason——all this to be brought about by reason itself The absolute freedom of all spints who bear the intellectual world within themselves and who may seek neither God nor immortality outside themselves：

The fragment closes with the proclamation of aesthetics as the pinnacle of the philosophy of mind and with a call for the creation or a new, popular mythologyY

In these scattered remarks it is not hard to discern the important themes of his famous period in Jena when he developed his speculations in natural philosophy. Nor is it any more dif ficult to perceive how close Schelling's application and extension of 'practical reason' comes to Hegel's concept of 'positivity'. It is easily comprehensible, therefore, why in their youth Schelling and Hegel should have regarded each other as allies. But it is no less important to see that even at this early stage there were profound——as yet unavowed— if ferences between the two men. As we have observed, Schelling's rejection of 'positivity' goes far beyond anything contemplated by Hegel. In principle and right from the start he regards the state and all its works as 'positive' in Hegel's sense; the liberation of mankind is identical for him with liberation from the state. This shows that at this early stage Schelling does not share, or has ceased to share, Hegel's revolutionary hopes for a radical regeneration of society and the state, a regeneration that will result in the abolition of their 'positive' qualities. He thus transforms Hegel's revolutionary utopia in which mankind is liberated from the state. And it is equally evident that such a view is very closely connected—whether as cause or effect is of little moment——with Schelling's energetic defence of Fichteanism at this time.

Hegel dif fers from his philosophical ally above all by virtue of his much more historical approach. He does not imagine every state to be 'positive', only the despotic state from Imperial Rome to the present day. The state of antiquity stands in sharp contrast to this: it is the product and expression of the free self-activity of man, of democratic society. Hence his goal and his perspective on the future is not the destruction of the state in general, but the reconstruction of the——non-positive—city-states of antiquity, of their free, spontaneous democracies.

In appearance and by comparison with the methodological practices of the age Hegel's approach is far less philosophical than Schelling's. Schelling operates with pairs of opposites derived from Kant and Fichte——freedom and necessity, essence and appearance——(opposites that coincide much more directly in Fichte's thought and his own, than they do in Kant); and he uses them in such a way as to turn epistemology wholly into ethics. And in this ethics anything which is not the subject of praxis, becomes a mere object (or in Hegel's terminology, is merely 'positive').This world of lifeless objectivity is identical with the Kantian world of 'appearances'. Only through praxis does man come into contact with true reality, with essence. We can now clearly see the connection between Schelling's use of Kantian epistemology and his own anti-historical standpoint. At the same time we can see why Hegel, for whom positivity was essentially an historical problem, could fi.nd little to interest him in the extension of Kant's theory of knowledge at the hands of Fichte and Schelling.

Hegel's indifference to his friend's ethical-epistemological constructions does not imply the absence of philosophical interests. In reality, we can see here the seeds of Hegel's later method of combining philosophical and conceptual problems with the historical development of objective reahty. When he takes the concept of positivity, which in theology and jurisprudence had been a general, unhistorical concept operating as the polar opposite to the natural religion of the deists or alternatively to natural law, and when he puts it at the very centre of his thought he takes the first, unconscious step in the direction of his later dialectical view of history. Of course, we must emphasize once more that at this time Hegel not only did not see the full philosophical implications of his approach; he scarcely concerned himself with his own philosophical premises.

The historical aspect of Hegel's method developed only gradually. Definite signs of it, in particular the distinction he makes between classical antiquity and Christianity, are in evidence from the start as far as we can see from the available sources. But his historical method matured only slowly; we shall see, in our discussion of his Frankfurt period in Part II, how the historical concept of positivity gains in flexibility and depth.

In his student days in Tubingen his methods still have a marked tendency towards anthropology and psychology. We have already mentioned that we possess a relatively rich harvest of notes and excerpts dealing with the 'anthropological' treatment of mental faculties, of the various physical and mental qualities of man, a collection which has drawn on almost the entire literature of the German Enlightenment. These extracts which have only appeared in the last few decades (first in the journal Logos, then in Hof fmeister's book) have not been exploited by students 01 Hegel. In particular, no research has been carried out on ,

the question of the extent to which they were incorporated into the 'anthropological' sections of the Phenomenology and the Encyclopaedia.

This question naturally goes beyond the framework of me present study. We should only like to make the general methodological remark that the historicization of 'anthropology' forms part of the general pattern of Hegel's overall development. This is not just confined to the Phenomenology where he attempted to integrate the problems of 'anthro-pology in an historical, dialectical process; it also forms an integral partof his entire later system. Thus concepts like "intuition’Anschauung],*idea’[ Vorstellung ,'concept’ [Begrif], all ofwhich appear in the originalnotes as "anthropological’problems, reappear in the later works as systematic principles (intuition: aesthetics; idea: religion; concept: philo-sophy).Furthermore they provide the foundation for his system ofperiodization (aesthetics: antiguity; religion: Middle Ages; philosophy:the modern world).

What interests us here is the original 'anthropological' contrast of memory and imagination. At this time Hegel made a distmction between objective and subjective religion. For objective religion

'the understanding and memory . .. are the effective forces at work ... Practical knowledge may be a part of objective religion, but if so it is no more than dead capital——objective religion can be organized in the mind, it can be systematized and put into a book or presented to others in the form oi a speech. Subjective religion finds expression only in feelings and actions ... Subjective religion is alive; inwardly, in essence, it is sheer efficacy; and outwardly it is activity.'

He goes on to compare subjective religion to the livmg organisms of nature and objective religion to the stuffed animals m scientif ic collec-tionsY This contrast is typical throughout the whole Berne period and the reader will have observed that the objective religion of the Tubingen notes represents an early form of the positive Christianity of Berne. I need cite only one further sentence from the Berne histoncal studies to illustrate the continuity of thought:

'memory is the gallows, on which the Greek gods have been hanged ... Memory is the grave, the repository of the dead. The dead dwell in it as dead matter. They are exhibited there like a collection of stones.'

This is followed by a sharp attack on Christian ceremony:

'This is the activity of the dead. Man strives to make himself into an object, submit entirely to the rule of an alien force. Such service is cafied worship. *

Hegel's position in Tubingen centres on a very sharp, Enlightened polemic against objective religion. In his eyes only subjective religion has any value. Admittedly, the latter still retains an unhistorical inflection, derived from the 'natural religion' or 'religion of reason' typical of the Enlightenment. Lessing is clearly the most potent influence here:

'Subjective religion is found among good men, objective religion can be of whatever colour you please, it hardly matters which——what makes me a Christian in your eyes, makes you a Jew in mine, Nathan says (Nathan the Wise, Act IV, sc. 7). For religion comes from the heart which is of ten unfaithful to the dogmas accepted by the understanding or the memory.'I5

In the Tubingen period the antithesis of objective and subjective religion of ten cuts across the other antithesis of public and private religion. A synthesis of the two pairs of opposites is only achieved in Berne. But even in Tubingen Hegel makes a distinct parallel between the subjective and the public on the one hand, and the objective and the private on the other.

Here we have palpable evidence of Hegel's dialectical method, long before dialectics as such became a conscious problem for him. For any formal, metaphysical approach would undoubtedly connect the subjective with the private rather than the public. If Hegel now spontaneously bursts the confines of metaphysical thought this is due partly to the growing effect of his historical awareness, and partly to tne irresistible longing for freedom released by the impact on him of the French Revolution. in his view subjective religion is a genuinely 'popular religion'. And the requirements which such a religion must satisfy are formulated as follows:

'i. Its teachings must be based on universal reason. 2. The imagination, the heart and the senses should not go away empty-handed. 3. It must be designed so that all the needs 01 life—the public acts of the state— ombine with it.'

And in the negative, polemical section that follows Hegel repudiates every faith based on fetishism, including that of the pseudo-Enlightened apologists of Christianity .16

Hegel's language here is perfectly unambiguous. We need only add that he explicitly assumes the rationality of subjective and public religion. Thus the reactionary interpretations that regard Hegel's contrast between memory and the imagination as the sign of his 'irrationalism' can be seen to be nothing more than slanders and distortions. As for the social content of his requirements, Hegel does not leave his view m doubt. He emphasizes that public religion should not just contain commandments and prohibitions, such as thou shalt not steal, but it

'must above all include less obvious factors which are indeed of ten the most important. Chief among these are the improvement, the ennobling of a nation's spirit——so that its sense of dignity, so of ten dormant, should be aroused in its soul, so that the people should not throw itself away, nor permit itself to be thrown away."

Thus even the Tubingen student already conceives of subjective, public religion as the religion of the self-liberation of the people.

God's existence is infeued from the 'clear signs we everywhere find of an order in accordance with a determinate purpose*. Since 'this purposive order is quite alien to the things of the world and only belongs to them contingently' there must exist 'a sublime and wise cause' beyond the world itself. Although Kant thinks that the proof always deserves to be mentioned with respect, he exposes its inadequacies, arguing that 'the utmost ... that it can prove is an architect of the world, . . . not a creator' and that the proof therefore needs to be supplemented by the cosmological proof which rests in turn on the ontological proof .

### CHAPTER 3 Historical perspectives and the present

Hegel, we may say, attempted to turn subjective, public religion into the foundation, the chief support of the freedom movement in Germany. We have already seen that these endeavours led to a strange mixture of historical objectivity and radical, philosophical subjectivism. Hegel's historical programme in Berne was to trace the democratic subjectivism of society in its highest and most developed form in antiquity; he went on to depict in darker colours the decay of that world and the emergence anti-human, despotic period of positive religion, and from a contrast of these two he tried to gain a perspective on the future emancipation. Thus the contrast between antiquity and Christianity, subjective and positive religion was the foundation of Hegel's political philosophy in Berne.

The practical character of his philosophy has naturally been noticed even by his reactionary interpreters. Haering goes so far as to place this problem in the centre of his study when he describes Hegel's 'popular pedagogic' leanings as the most signif icant elements of his development. There is nothing to object to in that, of course. But Haering ana other reactionary apologists make a point of interpreting Hegel's early views from the reactionary features of his later political position, implying that these constituted the ever-present 'essence' of Hegel's philosophy and making every possible use of the many, inevitable confusions in his early thought, especially in the.realm of religious thought, to prove the existence of reactionary tendencies at the very heart oi nis philosophy.

Of course, Hegel's early republican leanings cannot be entirely ignored. They are indeed obscured or overlooked wherever possible, but they cannot be wholly disregarded. The imperialist apologists find their way out of the impasse by dismissing his republicanism as an 'infantile disorder'. Franz Rosenzweig, for example, regards Hegel as a precursor of Bismarckian politics. Distorting and suppressing the available evidence in a completely anti-historical ushion, he firstly obscures the fact that even in his old age Hegel was never a precursor of Bismarck and that even his reactionary views were quite different from those of Bismarck. Secondly, he suppresses all the great historical crises (Thermidor, the fall of Napoleon) which had such a great influence on Hegel's political development and ended up by inducing that mood of profound resignation so characteristic of so many important Germans who hadhoped that the Napoleonic age would bring about a regeneration of their own country. (One thinks here of the later Goethe.) By discovering Hegel's similarity to Bismarck 'prefigured' in his soul from youth onwards, it becomes easy to represent his republicanism and his whole relationship with the French Revolution as something superficial that is gradually discarded with increasing 'maturity'.

Such writers remain quite unmoved by the fact that even the writings of the old Hegel state unambiguously his view that the French Revolution was historically inevitable and that it forms the basis of modern culture, etc. We need give only one example of this ingenious mixture of quotation and omission. Rosenzweig, in nis discussion of one of Hegel's early political writings, quotes all sorts of statements implying an ann-republican position, hostility to the Enlightenment etc. Then, with apparent objectivity but in effect blurring the truth, he adds contemptuous-

'But of course at this time Hegel's admiration for monarchy was only skin-deep.'I

We already know how closely the practical character of Hegel's philosophy was connected with his political dreams.We must now go on to show, with the aid of quotations, just how he saw the contemporary state of Germany as the product of that development whose chief characteristic he described as positive religion. This will help us to see why the emphasis on the freedom and democracy of antiquity implied a revolutionary contrast with the state of Germany at the time.

After what we have said it will come as no surprise to see that Hegel's views here too begin with religion and the religious tradition. Thus, speaking of the German tradition, he says:

'Our tradition—folk songs and such like. There is no Harmodius, no Aristogeiton to merit undying fame because they defeated their tyrants and gave equal rights and laws to their people, men whose names live on in the moutJis of the people, in their songs. What does the historical knowledge of our people amount to? We lack a specif ic, national tradition; our memory and imagination are filled with the pre-history of another people, with the deeds and misdeeds of kings who do not concern us.

In this context, Hegel compares German and Greek architecture; his interest here is not primarily aesthetic. He is much more concerned with the different ways of life: the free, beautif ul life of the Greeks, and the narrow, petty, philistine life of the Germans, a life punctuated only by uproarious and stupid drunkenness. The difference in architecture is merely an expression of the different life-contents of the two peoples. (Here too we find an approach that will latet reappear in the Aesthetics ——albeit at a quite different level of dialectical argument and historical concretization.)

We must turn once again to the principal writings of the Berne period, The Positivity of the Christian Religion to discover Hegel's most important observations about contemporary Germany. He talks there of the way in which first the Roman conquest and later Christianity destroyed the primitive national religions, including those of the Germans. And the development of Germany was of the sort that could provide no sustenance for a national, religious imagination.

'With the possible exception of Luther among the Protestants, who could be our heroes, when we have never formed a nation? Who could be our Theseus, to found our state and provide us with laws? Where are the Harmodiuses and Aristogeitons, the liberators whom we would celebrate in our skolia? The wars which have devoured millions of Germans were wars fought for the glory or independence of our princes—the nation was no ^^re than a tool and even though the people fought bitterly they would not have been able to say at tne end why or what they had gained by it?'

And Hegel goes on to give a sceptical account of the living heritage of Protestant historical traditions making the point that the German powers-that-be were not interested in ensuring the survival of the liberating aspect of Protestant tradition among the people.3

This analysis leads Hegel to the conclusion that the German people, which suffers from the absence of an indigenous religious imagination organically growing up alongside and interwoven with its history, is in addition 'entirely lacking in political imagination' .* And this absence of a national life of the imagination pervades the whole of German culture. Typically, what interests him primarily is not the great achievements of German culture, although he was intimately aware of them, but the absence of a popular German culture, with real roots in the people. This lack is the chief target of his complaints against contemporary German culture:

'The charmingjeux d'esprit of Holty, Biirger and Musaus in this sphere are quite lost on our people whose general level of culture is too low for it to be receptive to tne pleasures they of fer; similarly the imagination of the more educated classes of the nation inhabits a realm quite different from that of the lower classes, and the latter simply do not understand the characters and scenes of those authors and artists who cater for the former.'

Here too he makes a comparison with antiquity, pointing out that in Greece it was precisely the greatest art, that oi Socrates and Phidias, that was of the people and could move the entire nation.5

In this context Hegel defends the idea of a future German culture built on classical foundations. The growing influence of classical culture was the sine qua non of true progress and, in particular, he combats the views of Klopstock whose poetry has its sources partly in the early history of the German people (e.g. the battle in the Teutoburger Forest, [where Hermann or Arminius defeated the Roman Legions under Varus in ad 108——Trans.]), and partly in the Judaeo-Christian tradition (the latter as a belated and enfeebled echo of the ideological traditions of the English Revolution as mediated by Milton). To Klopstock's anti-classical: 'Is Achaia the fatherland of the Tuiscones?16 Hegel replies firstly with a lengthy argument to the effect that the artistic regeneration of the ancient German tradition was a task as hopeless as Julian's attempt to revive classical religion.

'That dream of ancient Germany finds nothing to correspond to it in our age; in the world of our ideas, opinions and beliefs it is as isolated and as alien as the Ossianic or Indian traditions ...'

And on the issue of aJudaeo-Christian revival he retorts:

'And what the poet says of Greek mythology we could say with equal justice of Judaeic mytns and ask: Is Judaea tne fatherland of the Tuis-cones?"

Here, too, especially on the issue of the Old German tradition we find Hegel putting a point of view he will retain his whole life long. He does not only have political objections to the wars of Liberation [i.e. the war against Napoleon——Trans.], he also regards with hostility all the nco-Germanic aspirations of the Romantics. This too has been ignored or ,reinterpreted' by the imperialist critics who endeavour to make Hegel into a Romantic.

This image of the pettiness and the lack of freedom of modern Germany, of the absence of a true popular culture, is closely linked with Hegel's overall democratic outlook at this period. During his stay in Berne, a city ruled at the time by a patrician oligarchy, Hegel reaches the same negative conclusions about this Swiss city as about Germany. And his judgement is even more explicitly political since he can speak more freely in a letter than in writings intended for publication, where he would have to keep the German censors in mind. Writing to Schelling on 16 April 1795, he says:

'Every ten years the conseil souverain increases its membership by roughly the numbers that have been lost during this period. You can have no idea of how human the whole business is. The intrigues among cousins and aunts at our princely courts are as nothing compared to the combinations here. The father nominates his son, or the son-in-law who brings in the greatest marriage portion, etc. To get to know an aristocratic constitution you just have to spend a winter here before the Easter selection. '8

This letter needs no commentary. His Berne experience evidently inspired in him an undying contempt for such aristocratic oligarchies. His dislike does not even abate when his other political opinions of the Berne period have been long since revised.

Hegel considers such political and cultural conditions to be the product of a development inspired above all by the hegemony of positive Christianity. And if he could refer to the 'glorious dawn* of the French Revolution even in his old age we can form some conception of the impatience with which he had awaited the regeneration of the world. This regeneration underlies his critique of Christianity and its positive content is the revival of the classical tradition. Hence, his analysis and praise of Greek democracy has a great immediate, political signif icance.

Here too Hegel's views have many precedents. In the great class struggles surrounding the liquidation of leudalism the model of Greek democracy played a leading role in the writings of the ideological vanguard from the Renaissance on. One of the greatest failures of the historiography of ideology is that the relationship between the classical revival and the struggles of the bourgeoisie for emancipation has never been adequately explored. Indeed, bourgeois historians have been at pains to obliterate the traces of this relationship, preferring to interpret the classical revival as an immanent concern oi art or philosophy, etc. Nevertheless, a true history of these ideological conflicts would show the intimate connections in every sphere from the plastic arts right through to politics and history. Furthermore, to make the point negatively it would show how the reverence for antiquity at once lost its progressive signif icance and degenerated into empty academicism as soon as this socio-political content disappeared in the course of the nineteenth century. Naturally, we cannot attempt even an outline of the development from Macchia-velli, via Montesquieu, Gibbon, etc., to Rousseau, in whose work, as Engels has emphasized, we find the first beginnings of a dialectical approach to the study of society.

It is apparent from the foregoing that Hegel was thoroughly conversant with the larger part of this literature. (The exception is Macchiavel-li, whose works he appears to have read later, probably towards the end of his stay in Frankfurt.) But even discounting these literary influences we can see that Hegel's admiration for the classical tradition was closely connected with this development, since it was on that tradition that the political philosophy of the French Revolution, and the systematization of its heroic illusions, was based. The leadingjacobins were the immediate pupils of Rousseau.

Even though theJacobin ideology of the revival of the classical democracies was tne heroic illusion of plebeian revolutionaries, it was by no means entirely arbitrary. Its exponents based their views on very real socio-economic premises. The distinction between them and the less radical supporters of a revolutionary democracy was itself economic: the radical Jacobins believed that the relative equality of wealth forms the foundation of real democracy, that the growth of inequalities among the citizens of a state leads inexorably to the destruction of democracy and to a new despotism. This doctrine appears in the radical parts of the literature on the classical revival referred to above and the idea that the relative equality of wealth is the premise of a democratic society reaches its peak in Rousseau's Social Contract.

The importance of the debates on this issue during the Revolution itself can be seen in any scrupulous history of the period. We need cite only a few instances. Thus in a frequently quoted essay by Rabaut St. Etienne in the ChroniquedeParis of 1793 we ffnd the following demands:

*1. The most equitable division of wealth possible, 2. Laws to preserve these and to prevent future inequalities from arising. '9

Rabaut generally went along with the Gironde. However this proposal naturally met with no response from them.10 Similarly, in the same year we find in the Revolution de Paris:

'In order to prevent great inequalities from arising in the wealth of the universally equal republicans an upper limit must be established above which acquisitions will not be permitted even assuming the payment of the appropriate taxes. ni

Likewise, a resolution of the People's Club of Castres determined:

'Never to deviate from our true principles and never to admit as a member any man with great wealth unless he is known as a pure and ardent patriot who has made every effort in his power to eliminate this inequality. n2

Finally, in the debate on progressive taxes and forced loans in 1793 Cambon stated:

'This system is the most rational and the one best in harmony with our principles, for such measures will bring about that very equality which some people would consign to the realm of fiction. n3

Such illustrations could be multiplied at will.

Marx has ruthlessly unmasked the illusory character of the Jacobin aspiration to revive the classical tradition, by analysing the very different economic circumstances underlying the two movements. In The Holy Family he writes:

'Robespierre, Saint-Just and their party perished because they confused the realistic, democratic republic of antiquity based on actual slavery, with the spiritualist, representative democratic state of modern times, with its basis in emancipated slavery in bourgeois society. What a colossal illusion to have to acknowledge and to sanction in the Rights of Man our modern bourgeois society, the society of industry, of universal competition, of private interests freely pursuing their own ends, of anarchy, of individuality alienated from its nature and its sprit —while at the same time, having been forced subsequently to annul the manifestations of the life of that society in separate individuals, they strive to model thepolitical head of the society in classical form!'"

However, in France itself these illusions were the heroic illusions of plebeian revolutionary politicians, i.e. notwithstanding their illusory character they were closely bound up with particular elements of the political actions of the plebeian party in the years 1793""4 Hence it was possible to carry out certain political measures essential m real terms, even with the aid of such a misconceived rationale. It is enough if we cite two instances. First, at a time when France was threatenea by the coalition of European powers the exigencies of the war made it necessary to pass a series of compulsory measures both to counteract counterrevolutionary tendencies (even in the bourgeoisie) and to ensure the maintenance of supplies to the army and the poorer sections of the population of the cities, the social basis of radical Jacobinism. Second, the radical prosecution of the democratic revolution involved the confiscation and distribution of a large number of feudal estates and so in intention and, for a time at least, in reality it brought about a partial scaling-down of landed property to the level of small peasant holdings.

Thus in line with Marx's criticisms we see that the actions of theJaco-bins were based on illusions in the sense that they failed to understand the real socio-political grounds for their revolutionary measures and they entertained utterly false ideas about their effects. However, their misconceptions do not negate the democratic, revolutionary essence of their actions. On the contrary, the living dialectical contradiction characteristic of this period of the revolution is the product of this indissoluble mixture of correct, plebeian revolutionary policies and fantastic illusions about the general direction of the forces o S bourgeois society unleashed by the revoluuon.

It is from this standpoint that we must examme the relation of the ideological forerunners of the revolution to the Jacobins themselves. Marx has pointed out, very rightly, that theJacobins enurely neglected the real basis of the society of antiqmty in slavery, because they were incapable of integrating the position and role of the proletariat in their picture of bourgeois society. This fundamental error does not, however, invalidate what was within certain definite limits a correct feeling that there was a genuine parallel between Greek society ..and a modern society based on roughly equal small-holdings. Marx clearly established this parallel:

'This independent ownership of free small-holdings as the dominant, normal form of ownership constitutes on the one nand the economic foundation of society in the greatest periods of classical antiquity, and on the other hand we also find it recurring in the modern world as one of the forms resulting from the dissolution of feudal landed property. Thus we find the yeomanry in England, the peasantry in Sweden and the French and West German peasants. . . . For the fullest development of this mode of production the ownership of land is as indispensable as the ownership of tools is necessary for the free development of handicraft. It forms the basis for the growth of personal independence. ns

These' observations are of outstanding importance for our discussion. Above all, Marx dryly points to the economic connection between the golden age of the ancient democracies and the relative equality of peasant ownership. For just as the emancipated freeholders formed the backbone of the army in the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars so too in the English Revolution the yeomanry were the backbone of the armies that freed the nation from the yoke of the Stuarts.

To this extent, then, the illusions of the Jacobins had real economic substance. The illusory side of their views is shown in their conviction that what was a transitional stage on the way to an advanced capitalism was a permanent condition of an emancipated humanity, i.e. they attempted to perpetuate what could be no more than a passing phase. The historical studies of Marx and Engels have produced voluminous evidence of the falsity and insubstantiality of these illusions. Engels, for example, points out that a century after the yeomanry had fought Cromwell's battles that same yeomanry had vanished almost without trace amid the storms of primitive accumulation, of Enclosures, etc. And Marx m his historical works on the French Revolution of 1848 has shown that the French smallholders were liberated from the yoke of feudalism only to find themselves beneath the much heavier yoke of capitalist money-lenders. The illusion of theJacobin revolutionaries, then, consists 'merely' in their failure to note the fact that their revolutionary measures actively unleashed the forces of capitalist development.

This idea and this reality exerted an extraordinarily profound influence on contemporary German philosophy. But as we come to look at this influence in greater detail we must again remind ourselves that even though German philosophy echoes the events of the French Revoluuon these echoes are distortea by the economic and political backwardness of the country. We have already asserted that the idealist character of

39

German philosophy is to be attributed to this backwardness. Now we must go further and note as the effect of this idealism the fact that the philosophers tended to concentrate on those aspects of the Revolution which expressed the most wayward illusions of those participating in it. That is to say, the German philosophers of the I 790s seized hold of these illusions ana systematized them, thus strengthening their illusory nature. These illusions were in themselves idealist distortions of objective reality; in their German form they became even more distorted: what we find are illusions of illusions.

Of all the German philosophers, Fichte was the one who came down most emphatically in favour of the French Revolution. His first books, published anonymously, were open pamphlets in defence of the Revolution and in opposition to its enemies, the absolutist feudal monarchies of Europe. And as late as 1796, when he began to systematize his views on practical philosophy in the narrower sense, in his Foundations of Natural Law, he drew the most radical conclusions from the illusions of the Jacobins. Like the traditions of jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Fichte's natural law was based on the idea of a social contract. However, it was modif ied on the one hand by the subjectivism of Kant and on the other by the social views of the Jacobins. Hence for Fichte the social contract implied the obligation of society to provide for the existence of its members——within the framework of a relative equality of wealth. He writes:

'All rights to property rest on the contract of all with all. This contract states: we al retain our property on the condition that we leave you in possession of yours. As soon as a man cannot live from his work, i.e. as soon as he is not left in ossession of his own, then as far as he is concerned the contract is null and void, and from that moment on he is no longer bound by law to recognize the property of any man.*16

These views of Fichte come close to those of the extreme left wing of the Jacobins. And interestingly, of all the German philosophers it was Fichte who adhered to them longest. Referring to The Closed Commercial State, Benjamin Constant noted scornfully at one point that Fichte was still writing in 18oo about a utopia whose principles were largely identical with the socio-economic policies of the last period of Robespierre's regime. Of course, we must atonceaddthe qualif ication that through his systematization Fichte became part of the trend that exacerbated these idealist illusions. (Fichte's later development, the internal conflicts arising in his thought in consequence of his joining the national liberation movement, do not fall within the scope ot this work. A brief indication, however, was necessary since in Ficnte5s case, too, bourgeois historiography has ignored or distorted the real problems and conflicts.)

Even in his Berne period Hegel never went as far as Fichte. We have already seen from his letter to Schelling how hostile he felt towards the radical, plebeian wing of Jacobinism. Despite this it cannot be denied that the Rousseauesque and Jacobin idea of the relative equality of wealth supplies the economic underpinning for his philosophy of the Revol ution. But his position has one peculiarity which we must take note of here, even though we shall defer our analysis of it until our discussion of his views on Christianity and antiquity. Briefly, it is the curious fact that in Hegel's eyes antiquity appears as an age almost without an economy. Hegel starts with the dogmatic assumption of a relative equality of wealth in the Greek city-states and then goes on to analyse only the poli tical, cultural and religious features in which their specific nature 1s revealed. In contrast to this, his observations on Christianity are full of remarks-however naive-about economics. For his view here is that this age Is the age of the private individual who is exclusively concerned With his own property. Thus for the early Hegel the decline of the pub he life of antiquity and the emergence of the age of despotism constitute the period of economic life as he understands it. Only after his Jacobin il lusiOns have come into conflict with reality does he feel the need for a greater grasp of economic problems. It is very characteristic, therefore, that it is not until relatively late, in his Jena period in fact, that he comes to appreciate the role of slavery in classical Greece.

This should not be taken to mean that Hegel was blind to social prob lems at this time. On the contrary, the problem of the division oflabour plays a very important role in his analysis of the difference between an tiquity and Christianity. That his analysis is not free from illusions, how ever, can be seen from his idealized views of antiquity as an age notable fo r the absence of a division oflabour and fr om his hope that a democra tic revolution would mean the return of that happy state.

In itself, of course, the critique of the capitalist division oflabour was a highly progressive element in humanist philosophy at this period. Schiller in particular deserves praise for having made the whole problem of such central importance. And we have already seen that Hegel read the relevant work, namely the Letters on Aesthetic Education, with real enthusiasm. In a study of Schiller's aesthetics I have shown at length that his entique of the divisi On of labour under capitalism was not the product of the anti-capitalism of the Romantics, but represented the continuation of the best traditions of the Enlightenment, above all the work of Fergus on.17 It cannot be discovered with any certainty just how much Hegel was influenced here by Schiller or indeed how much is to be traced back to Ferguson whose works he undoubtedly knew. What is important here is the similarity of Schiller and Hegel vis-a-vis Ferguson. In the writings of both men the economic basis of the division of labour is very much underplayed and they are much more concerned about its ideological and cultural implications. Of course, Hegel's special emphasis is on political action rather than art as the chief path from fragmentation back to the humanistic ideal of wholeness. For Schiller the greatness of classical art as the manifestation of man in an unfragmented

Even more important is the distinction between the views of the two men in respect to the philosophy of history. Schiller's book was written at a time when he had already turned away from the French Revolution. It is consequently filled with pessimism about the future and, equally naturally, antiquity has become   into a glorious age providing an eternal model for all mankind. At the same time this golden age now forms part of an absolutely irretrievable past. The Hegel of the Berne period finds himself at virtually the opposite standpoint. Antiquity survives as an actual, living example to mankind. It may have passed away but we must revive it; in fact, oiis revival constitutes the central practical, cultural and religious task of the modern age.

### CHAPTER 4 The republics of Greece and Rome

For the early Hegel, then, classical antiquity constituted a utopian political contrast to the present. The fragmentary works of the Berne period published by Noh! give us a very clear idea of the way he saw classical culture at this time. However, to grasp its fUll political implications we must refer to some fragmentary historical studies which illustrate its relation to the present much more vividly than Nohl's publications. Because of the importance of these fragments and because of the systematic falsif ications of Hegel's development by bourgeois scholars we must ask for the reader's indulgence if we quote these passages at length.

'In the states of the modern world, security of prop erty is the axis around which all legislation revolves and to which most of the rights of the citizenry pertain. In many of the free republics of antiquity, the constitution itself of ten encroached upon the strict rights of property, the concern of all our authorities and the pride of all our states. In the Spartan constitution security of property and industry was almost entirely disregarded, indeed one can almost say that it was forgotten. In Athens affiuent citizens were usually robbed of a part of their wealth. However, this was normally done under an honourable pretext: the person whom the state wished to rob was given an of fice which required enormous expenses. The citizens were divided into tribes and any member of a tribe who was elected to an expensive of fice could look around among the members of his tribe to see if he could not find someone wealthier than himself. If he succeeded in finding one and the latter claimed to be poorer, the first man could propose a mutual exchange of their possessions—a proposal which could not be refused. History shows in the cases of Pericles in Athens, of the patricians in Rome whose ruin the threatening power of the Gracchi and others vainly strove to avert by means of agrarian laws, and of the Medici in Florence, just how very dangerous the disproportionate wealth of a few citizens can become to even the freest form of constitution. It can even destroy freedom itself. It would be important to study how many of the strict rights of property would have to be sacrif iced if a republic were to be introduced permanently. Perhaps the system of the Sansculottes has been done a grave injustice by those who see rapacity as the sole motive underlying their wish for a greater

equality of wealth. 'I

These remarks require no commentary from us since we intend to cite further passages from the Berne studies that will illuminate them in a variety of ways. It was necessary to begin with this fragment because the connection between equality of wealth in antiquity and in the French Revolution, the problem of the equality of wealth as a foundation of re-publican freedom, emerges more clearly here than in most of Hegel's other Berne notes.

More interesting perhaps is the following fragment written in French on the subject of the army and the conduct of war under a monarchy and

a republic. The question of whether the fragment is the work of Hegel himself or only an excerpt has been the subject of fierce philological debate among his imperialist apologists. When Rosenkranz first published it he described it as Hegefs own independent work and indicated that it was the concluding section of an essay dealing with the changes necessary within the armed forces when a state changes from a monarchical to a republican form of government. (At this point we must again note that we have cause to regret the amazing negligence shown by Hegel's immediate disciples as the custodians oi his posthumous papers. The manuscript of the essay whose conclusion Rosenkranz has published has been lost in the meantime.) For their part more recent representatives biographer of Hegel, is no longer reliable. In the second place, even if Hof fmeister & Co. were right and the fragment were no more than an extract from a French manifesto, it would still prove nothing. For it would still leave us with the question of why Hegel had chosen this manifesto to copy and in what context he had used it in the—now lost ——essay. And since every unprejudiced reader of the Berne notes can see how well the fragment fits in with his entire philosophy of history and society, it becomes clear that the neo-Hegelians have done nothing to advance their cause with their 'sharp-witted philology'.

of 'modern scholarship', Lasson, Rosenzweig, Hof fmeister & Co. dispute the claim that the fragment could be Hegel's own work. 'The text reads more like demagogic speech by a French general than an essay by Hegel', Hof fmeister observes.2 Of course, the substantive value of this 'criticism' is more or less nil. For, in the first place, when it suits them, these neo-Hegelian gentleman always appeal to the fact that Rosenkranz was a direct disciple of Hegel and enjoyed the benefit of still living traditions in his editorial labours—and only in instances such as this one do they realize that 'suddenly' Rosenkranz, the first and most conscientious

Here is the text of thefragment:

'Under the monarchy the people became an active force only for the duration of armed conflict. Like a paid army it had to keep its ranks in the heat of battle. But no sooner was the victory won than it had to

return to a state of perfect obedience. Our experience accustoms us to seemg how at a word of command a mass of soldiers will enter into an organised fury of carnage and into the lottery of life and death, and how at another command they will again become peaceful. The same thing is required of a people that has armed Itself. Here the word of command is liberty, the enemy tyranny, the commander-in-chief the constitution, subordination obedience to the representatives of the people. But there is a great difference between the passivity of ordinary military obedience and the ardour of an insurrection; between obedience to the order of a general and the flame of enthusiasm which liberty pours into the vems of every living creature. This is the sacred flame that tunes every nerve and it is for its sake, for the sake of enjoy-ing this flame of liberty, that every nerve is keyed up. These efforts are the enjoyment of liberty, and you wish it to be renounced; these occupations, this activity for the public cause, this interest is the driving force, and you want the people to sink into inertia and boredom once more?':!

Both these passages speak a very clear language. They show how profoundly and intimately Hegel's enthusiasm for the classical democracies was interwoven with his attitude to the French Revolution. Our immediate task is to give a comprehensive picture of the classical ideal as cherished by Hegel in this period and to do so as far as possible in his own words since these are extremely telling and should not be weakened by paraphrase. We must begin our presentation with a lengthy general quotation from the chief work of this period, on positive Christianity, to which we have several times referred, before proceeding to his views on specific aspects of classical culture.

'The Greek and Roman religions were religions only for free peoples, and with the loss of freedom the strength they provided, their sense

and their appropriateness for man disappeared also. What is the use of an army of cannons that has run out of ammunition? It must go in search of other weapons. What is the use of a fisherman's net if the river has dried up? 'As free men they obeyed laws they had given themselves, they obeyed men they had installed in positions of authority, they waged wars they had themselves resolve upon, gave up their property and their passions and sacrificed thousands of lives for a cause that was their own. They neither learnt nor taught, but lived in accordance with maxims, performing actions they could call their own; in public, private and domestic life every man was free, each lived according to is own laws. The idea of his country, of the state was the invisible higher thing for which he laboured and which spurred him on; this was the ultimate purpose of the world, or at any rate of his world——a purpose he found enacted in reality, or which he helped to enact and to maintain. His individuality bowed to his idea, he required subsistence, life and permanence for it alone and could himself provide for his needs. It would not ever, or only seldom, occur to him to want or to implore permanence or eternal life for himself; only in passive, inert moments would he feel a strong desire for something merely for himself.——Cato only turned to Plato's Phaedo when his republic, his world, when what had been the highest order of things was destroyed;:only then did he seek refuge in an even higher order.

'Their gods reigned supreme in the realm of nature, ruling over everything which makes man happy or unhappy. High passions were their work, as were great gif ts o wisdom, eloquence and of counsel. Their advice was sought about the successful or unsuccessful outcome of an enterprise, men implored their blessing and gave thanks for gif ts of every kind—when man came into open conflict with these rulers over nature he could oppose them with nis own freedom. Man's will was free, it obeyed its own laws; men knew no divine ordinances or if they called the moral law divine, it was not handed down to them on any tablets: it ruled invisibly (Antigone). At the same time, they acknowledged every man's right to nave his own will, be it good or bad. The good recognized their own duty to be good, out also respected the rights of others not to be able to achieve the same ideal. For this reason they proclaimed neither a divine morality, nor one invented or abstracted by themselves for others to cleave to.

'Victorious wars, the growth of wealth and an increased familiarity with several comforts or life, with luxury, produced an aristocracy of wealth and military glory. This aristocracy acquired influence and power over many men who, corrupted by the sight of their deeds and even more by the use they made of their wealth, gladly and willingly granted them power and authority in the state. . . . Soon the freely granted authority was maintained by force and this in itself presupposes the loss of that feeling, that consciousness which Montesquieu calls virtue and makes into the essential principle of a republic; its character is the ability to sacrif ice an individual in order to save an idea that has been realized in a republic for its citizens.

'The image of the state as a product of his own activity faded from the soul of the citizen; understanding and concern for society as a whole became the province of a single man, or a few men; each man was assigned a more or less limited place, different from that of his fellows; the government of the machine of state was entrusted to a small number of citizens and they served as individual cogs whose value lay in their association with each other. The part assigned to each man in the fragmented totality was so minute in comparison to the size of the whole that the individual did not need to see or understand it. Usefulness to the state was instilled in its subjects by the state and the aim they all set themselves was acquisition and selfsubsistence and perhaps also vanity. All activity, all purposes henceforth referred to individuals. There was no longer any activity for the whole, for an idea—ach man either laboured for himself or was forced to work for another. The freedom to obey self-imposed laws, to follow self-imposed authorities in peace and in war to obey generals who were implementing plans which all had resolved upon—all this died out. All political freedom faded away; the law only gave the citizen a right to the security of property, the pursuit of which now filled his entire life. The phenomenon that tore to shreds the whole web of his intentions, the activity of his whole life, namely death, became something terrible for him: for nothing survived him, unlike the republican whose republic lived on after him and so he began to conceive the vague idea that his soul must be immortal.也

The main outlines of Hegel's view of the democracies of Greece and Rome stand out very clearly. The implicit reference to the present, to the French Revolution can hardly escape the unprejudiced reader and this impression is strengthened by comparison with the passages cited earlier.

is revealing, fo「instance, now of ten Hegel departs from the objective ,

tone of the narrative historian and speaks simply of republicans and republican virtue, quoting Montesquieu admittedly, but the reader cannot help thinking of the republican virtues proclaimed by Robespierre.

The parallel is reinforced by the argument that the crucial factor in the decline of the republics of antiquity was the abolition of equality of wealth. Moreover, the reader cannot fail to be struck by the naive and ideological manner in which Hegel construes the transition from freedom to unfreedom. He sees the importance of the economic factors diagnosed fi.rst by Rousseau, but only abstractly and without being able to supply the concrete mediating links from them to the ideological problems that interest him primarily.

Hegels central ideological problem here is, once again, what he calls , subjectivity in contrast to positivity. In the sphere of pure politics this can be expressed relauvely clearly: men obey self-created laws, selfchosen authorities, the state is continually produced by their activity. And it is characteristic of Hegel's position at this stage that he rejects the idea of class, whether spiritual or secular, for this state of society. We have already seen how he disregarded the existence and signif icance of slavery in classical antiquity. His conception of classical society was essentially classless. As soon as class distinctions became economically and politically fixed, real freedom was at an end.

We must emphasize that here too his account of the processes at work is extraordinarily abstract and very ideological. Thus in one of the earliest Berne studies he writes:

'But when a class---either the ruling class or the priests, or both together——loses that spirit of simplicity which had brought into being and hitherto inspired their laws and ordinances, then not only is it irreparably lost but also the oppression and dishonouring of the people is certain. (For this reason, the mere division into classes is already dangerous to freedom since it can foster an esprit de corps which can become a threat to the spirit of the whole. )5

This rejection of the classes in a democracy is as determined as it is naive. Nevertheless, we should not overlook the fact that here in Hegel we see the first faint glimmerings of an understanding of gentile society. Of course, even the later Hegel never acquired a definite conception of gentile society——Bachof en was the 6rst to develop any real understanding of that, despite the presence of idealist and mystical distortions in his work. But it is beyon a dispute that the analysis of the tragic conflict of the Antigone in The Phenomenology of Mind, or the much later aesthetic conception of the heroic age (in the Aesthetics) contain strong suggestions of this state of society in a mystif ied form. In the early writings Hegel's understanding of this issue is still highly abstract: on the one hand, there is abstract equality (classless society), on the other hand, the complete self-government, self-activity of the people. However, the sober and realistic appraisal of the facts of daily life, which we have already seen in his letter to Schelling about the material basis of orthodoxy, is never far from the surface. Thus it is not without interest to observe him speaking of the festivals of antiquity with the greatest enthusiasm, but without failing to point out that an essential feature of these festivals was that they were not merely arranged by the people but that the people also administered all the religious donations.6

The freedom and independence of the people is the source of the nonpositive, non-fetishized, non-objective character of classical religion. Now Hegel is, of course, perfectly aware, despite his extreme subjective and idealist interpretation of 'practical reason', that a world wholly without objectivity, without any objectif ication of thoughts and feelings, is quite impossible. He therefore strives to define in a series of complex arguments and analyses the specific character of the 'objectless' objectivity of antiquity.

I shall give an extreme and for that reason very revealing example from his numerous analyses of this issue. In the course of his historical studies Hegel has occasion to speak of the role of women mourners at the public funerals in Athens. He comes to regard even tears as an objec-tif icauon of grief.

'But since gnef is essentially subjective, it only externalizes itself with reluctance. Only the gravest exigency can induce it to do so. . . . This cannot take place through the agency of something alien to it. Only if it is given to itself will it possess itself as itself and as something partly outside itself. . . . Speech is the purest form of objectivity in the eyes of subjectivity. It is not yet anything objective, but it is the movement towards objectivity. Lament in the form of a song achieves the form of beauty to a higher degree since it moves in accordance with rules. The elegies of women mourners are therefore the most human expression of grief, of the need to lighten one's burden by developing it to its fullest extent and contemplating it in its true proportions. This contemplation alone is the balm."'

The decisive moment here for Hegel is that the object is not fixed, not established for ever; there should never be an ultimately defined object but only a progress towards objectivity and then a return to a modif ied purif ied suojectivity.

This line of reasoning is very closely connected with his purely political, republican image of antiquity. The life of man in Greece or Rome had its centre in the realm of the public. At the same time, men are free, autonomous individuals with their own fates. Their private thoughts. feelings and passions must be so constructed that they never remain fixed at this one point: they must always be able to flow sm'oothly back into the stream of public life.

In this period Hegel frequently draws comparisons between Jesus and Socrates. He notes in passing the fetish involved in fixing the number of Jesus' disciples at twelve, but his main point is thatJesus took his disciples out of society, out of life, cutting them of f and turning them into men whose chief characteristic was precisely their disciplehood. In the case of Socrates, his disciples remain social, they stay as they are, their individuality is not remoulded artif icially. They return therefore into public life enriched;

'each of his disciples was himself a master; many founded schools, several were great generals, statesmen, heroes of all kinds'.

Jesus, however, created a narrow-minded, closed sect; 'among the Greeks he would have been an object of laughter'.8

In Hegel's view, then, the ever-open road back into public life is the foundation for normal existence in the classical world and this stands in sharp contrast to the deformed and deforming pathology of man under Christianity.

Once again we can best throw light on Hegel's position by citing one of his more extreme examples. He repeatedly comes back to the distinction between the Bacchantes of antiquity and the witches of the Middle Ages.

'In the bacchanalia, Greek women were given room to express their pent-up passions. Their physical and emotional exhaustion was succeeded by their peaceful return to the realm of their normal feelings and their accustomed lives. Outside the festivals the savage Maenad was a rational woman.'

Thus the main point about the Greeks was 'the return to ordinary life', whereas in the witchcraft of the Christian age we ffnd

'the advance from isolated outbreaks of madness to a thorough-going and permanent derangement of the mind. "l

We are less concerned here with the accuracy of Hegel's interpretation of the classical Bacchanalia, than with his general interpretation of life in antiquity, with the living interaction between public and private, with the free, creative suspensions of the private in public life that prove to be valid even where, as here, the more pathological sides of human nature are involved.

The precise definition of this interaction is important for our understanding of Hegel because it enables us to see just now remote his republican subjectivism is from individualism in the modern sense. Inde< might argue that Hegel's position is the antipole of modern individualism. Hegel was of course perfectly familiar with the latter phenomenon, which, however, he thought of as the product of decadence, of positive religion and of the Christian era. It is highly indicative of Hegel's historical perceptiveness that for all the mystif ication and tortuousness of his subjective idealism, he nevertheless had a very clear insight into the connection between modern individualism as an ideology and a life-style, and the actual fragmentation and impoverishment of human personality in the course of the medieval and post-medieval periods. At the same time, he is equally aware of the fact that man can only develop a manysided, mature personality if and when social conditions permit and encourage this sort of harmony, and if they promote a vital interaction between a man's public and private life.

Hence the impoverishment and mutilation of man's life is one of the persistent themes of Hegel's critique of the modern world. He made excerpts from the great travel-book by the MainzJacobin Georg Forster and was particularly impressed by the latters contrast between the art and culture of antiquity and the modern world which in Forster's case, too, stems from a republican spirit. Hegel's extracts are followed by this contrasting picture of life in modern and classical times:

'In a republic one lives for an idea, in a monarchy only for specific things—ven in a monarchy, men cannot dispense with ideas, they ,, fix on a particular idea, an ideal—m a republic they live according to ideas as they ought to be; in a monarchy, they have an ideal, i.e. rarely something they have made themselves, a deity.—In a republic, a great mind expends his entire physical and moral energies in the service of his idea; the sphere of his activity has unity. The pious Christian who dedicates himself to his ideal is a mystical fanatic. If his ideal fills him to the exclusion of all else, if he cannot divide his energies between this and his secular life, if all his strength goes in this one direction, a Mme de Guyon10 will be the result——The need to contemplate the ideal will satisfy the over-stimulated imagination, and even the senses will assert their rights; examples are the countless nuns and monks who dallied with Jesus and dreamed of embracing him. The idea of the Republican is of the sort that enables his noblest energies to find satisfaction in true labour, while that of the fanatic is a mere figment of the imagination.'

Hegel follows this up with a comparison, still based on Forster, of classical and Christian art (architecture in particular) which, as might be expected, comes down hrmly on the side of classical art. But here too we must note that art is not considered for its own intrinsic value but as the expression of the different social life-styles of the two great epochs.11

We can see how radically Hegel criticizes the whole modern tradition from a polemic directed against Schiller whom he nevertheless greatly venerated even at this early period. In his On Naive and Sentimental Poetry of 1795--96, an essay of absolutely fundamental importance for the definition of modern literature, Schiller had indeed acknowledged the incomparable and undying greathess of classical poetry. At the same time, however, he attempted to provide an historical and philosophical justif ication of modern literature. Schiller's efforts in this direction—no less than the similar tendencies in Goethe—had a profound influence on Hegel's later views on modern art. In this period, however, Hegel ignores these historical and philosophical discoveries. Indeed, without mentioning Schiller by name, he conducts a vigorous attack on one section of his treatise.

On Naive and Sentimental Poetry contains a passage in which Schiller praises modern poets at the expense of classical ones for their superior representation of love.

'Without wishing to encourage sentimentality [Schwarmerei] which indeed does not enhance nature but abandons it, we may still believe, I hope, that in regard to the relations between the sexes andthe emotion of love, nature can possess a nobler character than has been given it by the Ancients.'

He supports his arguments with references to Fielding and Shakespeare. We must remind ourselves of the history of individual love and its

reflection in poetry in Friedrich Engels' key work The Origins of the Family to appreciate the accuracy of Schillers assessment of the historical factors, even though he could have no idea of their underlying causes. Hegel's polemic, however, is directed precisely at Schiller's genuine insight. In the modern over-estimation of love, and its lower place in the scale of values of antiquity, he sees yet another instance of the sociopolitical contrast he discusses so frequently. He asks,Does this phenomenon have nothing to do with the spirit of their [i.e. the Greeks'] free life!'

He imagines a situation in which a knight regales Aristides, the Athenian statesman, with an account of all the deeds he had performed out of passion, without mentioning the object of these deeds. In this situation, Hegel remarks,

'would not Aristides who did not know to whom or what this entire expenditure of feeling, action and enthusiasm was devoted, exclaim in wonder: I have dedicated my life to my country; I have laboured for it without expecting any distinction, or power or wealth as reward. But I am aware that I would not have done so much for it, I could not have held it in the same unique and profound veneration as you have-displayed. I know of Greeks who nave done more, who were more greatly inspired, but I know of none who had ever attained the same heights of self-denial as yoursel£ And what was the object of your noble life? It must be infinitely greater and worthier than anything I can imagine, greater even than freedom and my country !'12

Here, in Hegel's ironical repudiation of the entire modern cult of individual love, we find an inspired paean to the normative life of antiquity. Hegel rejects the sentimental culture of the modern world because it is exaggerated, because it squanders lof ty feelings on merely individual, merely private and hence unworthy objects. The only objects worthy of heroic deeds are freedom andone's country.

These views contain a certain admixture of republican asceticism which likewise forms part of the armoury of the Jacobin followers of Rousseau and which Hegel had been prepared for philosophically by the idealist asceticism of The Critique of Practical Reason. However, his radicalism goes far beyond that of Kant whom he criticizes for his inconsistent application of ascetic principles in morality.

It is well known that in his ethics Kant refused to permit any connection between the imperatives of duty and sensuality, or any suggestion that their form and content could be modif ied by men's claims to sensual happiness. Hegel is in agreement with this. Where he demurs is when, in drawing out the religious implications of his ethic, Kant introduces the idea that we may become worthy of happiness, an idea which is closely connected to the sudden appearance of God as a 'postulate of practical reason '.13 In this Hegel sees above all a renewal of positive religion. In his view the Kantian etnic calls for

'an alien being, in whom the control over nature resides, a control which nature misses and which it can no longer afford to despise. In this philosophy faith means a lack of awareness that reason is absolute, complete unto itself—that its infinite idea must be created from itself alone, free from the admixture of anything alien to it, and that this can be achieved only through the removal of that intruder [i.e. the Kantian God——G.L.] and not through his presence.——The so-conditioned ultimate purpose of reason provides a moral faith in the existence of God which cannot be practical . . .n4

Hegel here shows Kant's ethics to be inconsistent with its own premises. In the process he frees it from the proof s of the existence of God that Kant had smuggled back m at the cost of intensif ying the asceticism of The Critique of Practical Reason.

However, this is not the decisive motif of Hegel's criticism. He does indeed believe that Kant's God is mfected by the 'positivity' he rejects so emphatically in his Berne penod, but his ultimate objection to Kant's arguments is that he sees them as an obstacle to the creation of an heroic, republican morality, as an expression of modern philistinism. Thus he observes scathingly:

'In our age all we can say of a man who has just died honourably for his country or virtue, is that he deserved a better fate.'

And in the course of his attack on the 'positive' character of Kant's synthesis of happiness and morality m his postulated God, he adds:

'Anyone, e.g. a repubhcan or a soldier who is fighting not perhaps for his country, but at any rate for his honour, who has set himself a certain goal and does not manage to achieve that other goal, viz. happiness, nevertheless has a goal whose fulfilment depends entirely on himself and he does therefore not stand in need of any help from outside.'15

It is evident that Hegel reserves his praise here for the ascetic heroism of the French Revolution and m consequence imports a number of features into his portrait of antiquity which have nothing to do with antiquity itself. But m all these arguments we see how Hegel saw the complete fulfilment of human aspirations, the real development of the essential forces of human personality exclusively in an absolute service to one's country, to the interests of public life and to the republic. And conversely, in every aspiration aimed solely at the private lire of the individual, he saw only philistinism.

Here too, in his ironic treatment of philistinism, it is important to take the precise historical circumstances into account. Bourgeois historians in Germany are accustomed to classif y every attack on philistinism as part of Romanticism. In Hegel's case, however, this would be quite misleading. Bourgeois literary historians have been accustomed to classif y Holderlin as a Romantic and Holderlin stands ideologically very close to Hegel's early philosophy; and now it is fashionable to classif y Hegel along with the Romantics also. That this is wrong in principle can be seen if we point out that the Romantic critique of pnilistinism was aimed at its modern, prosaic elements to which they opposed an aesthetic ideal. Hence the Romantic critique tends on the one hand to slip into an apology for Bohemian or anarchistic leanings, and on the other hand it

, glorif ies the moral and spiritual narrow-mindedness of a pre-capitalist society of craftsmen which has not yet experienced the division of labour.

With all this Hegel and his colleagues have little in common. For Hegel, philistinism is in fact the survival of medieval narrowness in the life and thought of modern times. And he never attacks philistinism in the name of an aesthetic ideal. What characterizes philistinism in his view is imprisonment in the problems of purely private interests, and nence the counter-idea is, as we nave seen, the compicic identity of the citizen with the affairs of public life so typical of the Greek city-state. Marx, too, has given a penetrating definition of the specific features of theJacobin position:

'Jhe whole of French terrorism was nothing but a plebeian method of dealing with the enemies of the bourgeoisie, with absolutism, feudalism and philistinism. *

It is evident then that Hegel's critique of philistinism belongs in the general framework of his campaign for the aims of democratic revolution.

Thus Hegel confronts the Christian, philistine ethics of the 'private man' with the heroic ethics of public life. He takes this confrontation so far as to defend the right to suicide, conducting his defence with classical examples and Stoic arguments. This line of reasoning is by no means unique in the eighteenth century. Goethe's Werther contains a passionate vindication of the right to commit suicide and here too Goethe s position is connected with the struggle for democratic freedom. However, Hegel goes beyond this in the direction of the exclusive predominance of public life, of the interests of the republic and freedom. Only in such a context does he find suicide morally defensible. He quotes from a number of Christian, philistine condemnations of suicide and concludes:

Cato, Cleomenes and others who took their own lives after the free constitutions of their countries had been abolished did so because they found it impossible to return to private life; their souls had embraced an idea which they could no longer work for; once their soul had been exiled from its greater sphere of activity it longed to be rid of the fetters of the body so as to return to the world of eternal ideas. *17

The problem of death, of dying, is an integral part of Hegel's confrontation of the greathess of classical republicanism with the pettiness and debasement of modern Christianity. Hegel wants no part of the Christian view of the utter contrast of life and death; he regards dying as necessary and organic continuation of the way a man has conducted his life.

'The heroes of all nations die in the same manner, for they have lived and in the course of their lives they have learnt to recognize the power of nature. The failure to suffer its lesser evils disables a man from enduring its greater tests. How could it otherwise come about that the peoples in whose religion the preparation for death forms a corner-stone should on the whole die so unmanfully, while other nations approach this moment undaunted.'

This is followed by an account of the beauty of death among the Greeks, an account influenced in important ways by Schiller's philosophical poems. And Hegel goes on to compare this beauty with the narrow pettiness of positive religion, of Christianity:

'For this reason we see how the beds of the ailing are surrounded by friends and priests who overwhelm the anguished soul of the dying with their half-suppressed, prescribed groans and sighs. "8

And elsewhere he even aims his mockery at the death of Jesus, speaking ironically of the way the entire world is expected to feel gratitude to Jesus for his self-sacrifice,

'just as if many millions had not given their lives in a lesser cause, without the sweat of fear, but with a smile, with joy even, for their king, their country, their loved one——how would they have died then for humanity—. "9

These are the essential features of classical antiquity as compared with Christiamty. Once the reader has familiarized himself with this material he will require no further proof , I believe, that Hegel projected this image of antiquity into the utopian picture of a republic of the future, and that each constantly influenced the other. From the standpoint of Hegel's later development it is particularly important to underscore this view of antiquity, above all the fact that antiquity was in his eyes not just part of history, but a living model for the present, and

'centuries will pass before the spirit of Europeans will make them realize and teach them how to implement in their daily life and their legislation those things which the Greeks' own feelings naturally taught them.'

The exemplary status of the Greeks has, as we have seen, democratic republicanism as its political content. Its philosophical manifestation is the radical subjective idealism of the early Hegel, his energetic, passionate repudiauon of the positive religion of Christianity with its anu-human despotism.

### CHAPTER 5 Christianity: despotism and the enslavement of man

When we come to Hegel's treatment of Christianity, that hated and despised incarnation of philosophical positivity, of political despotism, we shall not only find a completely different tone——that is very plain to see——but also a much more historical approach, though even here it does not go beyond the limits set to Hegel's insight into historicity m his Berne period.

We have seen how Hegel established a dose connection between the economic foundations of antiquity——as viewed through Rousseauesque spectacles——and its republican heroism and greathess. But we have also observed that the problem of the origins of such a society never came to the surface. For the early Hegel classical antiquity was a purely utopian ideal. His unhistoncity here was not simply the result of his extreme philosophical subjectivism; for we have seen that this by no means needs preclude a very realistic appraisal of specific concrete social factors. We believe instead that his failure to develop an historical view of classical antiquity was closely related to the economic and political backwardness of Germany. However illusory the dream of a revival of classical republicanism had been, even in France, it nevertheless stood in a real relationship to the real goals of an actual revolution and its ideological preparation. In France, the possibility and necessity of relating these ideals and illusions to social realities brought about a much more genuinely histoncal view of classical anuquity. In Germany, however, the state of society did not yet allow the possibility of a democratic revolution. Hegel's enthusiasm, therefore, was purely ideological. For this reason it is nothing more than a wish-fulfilment and inevitably the question of how to bring about such a revolution remams the weakest, vaguest and least concrete aspect of his argument. (We shall see that this weakness persists unchanged for a long time and is never fully overcome.) Hegel's Berne period not only represents the culmination of his revolutionary enthusiasm, but also——in consequence of the gulfbetween ideology and social reality in Germany——it is the period of his greatest abstraction. This abstraction, this remoteness from a real purchase on future possibilities, is reflected in his unhistorical approach to the question of how the classical civilization of his ideal ever came into being.

When we come to his interpretation of Christianity, the situation is

quite different. Here an .historical approach follows directly from his revolutionary enthusiasm. The greater his enthusiasm for Greece, the more extreme the contrast between that and the wretchedness of life in the succeeding era became; whereas the more he suffered under modern, Christian society, the more energetically, historically and concretely he was forced to put the question: how could such a beautif ul and human society perish and give way to such a wretched one? Thus he writes:

'The ousting of heathen religion by Christianity is one of those miraculous revolutions the causes of which must be sought by the reflective historian. The great, public revolution must have been preceded by a silent, secret revolution in the spirit of the age, a revolution not visible to anyone, least of all to living contemporaries and one which is as dif ficult to describe as to comprehend. Ignorance of these revolutions in the world of the spirit results in amazement at the endproduct; a revolution such as the ousting of an age-old, indigenous faith by a strange one is inevitably fought out much more immediately in the realm of the spirit and so its causes must be sought directly in the spirit of the age.——How can a religion be supplanted which has been established in a state for centuries and which is intimately bound up with the constitution, how can people cease to believe in gods to whom cities and empires ascribe their origins, to whom the peoples daily of fered up sacrif ices, whose blessings they mvoked for all their affairs, beneath whose banner their armies were alone victorious, to whom they had expressed thanks for their victories, to whom they dedicated their songs when happy, and their prayers when downcast, whose temples and altars, treasures and statues had been the pride of entire peoples, the renown of the arts, and whose worship and festivals were the occasion for universal joy——how was it possible for the myriad threads binding faith in the gods to the texture of human life to be torn asunder and broken?''

Hegel's basic historical explanation is the one we have already seen in the essay, The Positivity of the Christian Religion: It is explained by the development of mequalities of wealth which according to Hegel, and indeed to his French and English predecessors, inevitably brings despotism in its wake. Here too Hegel does not achieve the historical concreteness of Gibbon or Ferguson, Montesqmeu or Rousseau. It should be remembered, therefore, that when we speak of a more historical approach here we are only speaking relatively, bearing in mind the limited possibilities available to him.

But this greater historicity shows itselfabove all in the fact that Hegel attempts to explain the dominance of Christianity with reference not to the nse of Christianity in the first instance, but to the decline of the states of classical antiquity. His premise, therefore, is that there was a social need for a religi0n to fill the gap left by the loss of freedom, and he explains that Chnstianity was the victor because it was suited to this end.

'In this situation, without faith in anything stable or in an absolute, accustomed to obey an alien will and alien laws, without a country, in a state which promised no happiness . . . in this situation a religion presented itself to men which either was adapted to the requirements of the age (for it had its roots in a people equally, if differently, corrupt, vapid and sterile)——r else it was a religion from which men could mould or fashion whatever their needs dictated. '2

The primary factor for Hegel, then, is the erosion of the old democratic freedom, the old free activity of the people, through the emergence of inequality of wealth. Corresponding to the old state of affairs is that nonpositive religion which in reality was nothing but the spur, the incentive to hermc action in the midst of a natural life lived close to nature. The destruction of these forms of life is the most important process studied here by Hegel. He repeatedly returns to the fact that the extension of the Roman Empire meant the levelling out of the vanous nations and the destruction of their national religions. Probing further he discerns a link between the destruction of the old relations between man and nature, and the fall of the Roman Republic.

'Through the establishment of the Roman Empire which deprived almost the entire known world of its freedom, nature was subjected to a law alien to man and cut of f from him. Its life became stone and wood; the gods became created and servile beings. Wherever force came to life, benevolence was revealed or greathess ruled, there the heart and character of man was to be found. Theseus only became a hero to the Athenians after his death . . . The Roman Caesars were deified. Apollonios of Tyana3 performed miracles. The great was no longer divme, and therefore no longer beautif ul or free. In this separation 4 the natural and the divine a man came to jom them together, as conciliator and redeemer.，4

Hegel goes on to examme the vanous spiritual trends prevalent during the decline of Rome m order to discover just how the process led mexo-rably to the acceptance of Chnstianity.

'After the destruction of Greek and Roman freedom, when men's ideas lost control over the objects, the genius of mankind split in two. The spirit of the corrupt moh said to the objects: I am yours, take me! and hurled Itself into the nvcr of objects, let itself be swept along by them and perished m the flood.'

There follows ananalysis of the various spiritual currents which opposed this process, and with an histoncal msight that is quite amazmg for the time, he concludes that for all their opposition they were unable to change the basic tendency. Thus he refers to this general pattern to explain the fact that the late Roman Stoles turned away from life. (It is revealing that at this period he says nothing either about the Epicureans or the Sceptics. In Jena we find him preoccupied w1th the Sceptics and he shows great understanding of them. He was never able, however, to get his beanngs properly with Epicurus.) Hegel goes on to show how the feeling of impotence led to the assumptmn of objects imperceptible by the senses, to the worship of these objects and thence to the vanous theur-gic movements. He shows further that there is a straight line from here to Christianity. In conclusmn, he states:

'In its maturity the church combined the desire of the Stoics with that of these mwardly broken spirits. It permits men to live amidst the whirl of objects and opens up the prospect of elevating men above them by means of easy exercises, sleight of hand, trembling of the lips, etc.'5

In Hegel's view, then, the essential factor that produced the need for a new religion in the Roman world, a need satisfied by Christianity, was the withering of repubhcan virtue and freedom, the increasmgly private nature of all aspects of life. This was the climate so favourable to the development of individualism in the modern sense of the individual who cares exclusively for his own narrow, material or at best spuitual needs and who thinks of himsclf as an isolated 'atom'; the social activity of such a man can only be that of a small wheel in an enormous machine, whose overall purposes he neither can nor wishes to comprehend. Thus according to Hegel modern individualism is also the product of the division of labour within society. In such a society the need naturally springs up for a pnvate rcligmn, a religion of private life.

We have seen already from the Tiibingen Notes that Hegel regarded the private nature of Christiamty as its most important characteristic. In contrast to the religions of the Greeks and Romans which always address themselves to the entire people, Christianity refers primarily to the mdi-vidual and to his salvatmn, the redemption of his soul.

Hegel also turned his attention to a further historical question. The Chnsuamty adopted by Imperial Rome was not identical in all respects with the fanh originally founded by Jesus as this has been handed down to us in certam parts of the New Testament.

This issue is an age-old subject of debate and fills the pages of the history of religwn. As early as the Middle Ages, the revolutionary sects made a polemical contrast between the practices of the Church and the onginal teachings of Jesus, and m the decline of the latter they discerned the reasons for the decline of Christianity and for its falling into the hands of explmters and oppressors. These ideas were very influential among the supporters of Thomas Miinzer and the radical wing of the Puritans during the English Revolution. After the latter event the practice of making particular dogmas and stories from the Old and New Testaments serve as ideological ammunition gradually died out among radical political movements. The preparatory stages of the bourgeois, democratic revolution in France evince an increasing hostility towards all the manifestations of Christianity: towards both the Church and the religion itself. This does not mean, however, that the confrontation between the moral precepts of Jesus and the immoral praxis of the Church ceased to play a part m the anti-clerical polemics of the Enlightenment. Even in the French Revolution itself, we ffmd the sporadic appearance of Jesus the good Sansculotte* as a counter-weight to monarchical and counter-revoluticnary priests. In a more backward Germany, where as we have seen there was neither a defmite trend towards atheistic materialism, nor a radical attack on religion in general and where even in the camp of the Enlightenment the 'religion of reason* could be of paramount ideological importance, the incorporation of many of Jesus' sayings and teachings (such as The Sermon on the Mount) within 'rational religion' was only to be expected.

Naturally enough, views as prevalent as these could not fail to mfl.u-ence Hegel. As we shall see in Part II, in the course of his crisis in Frankfurt, this German approach even strengthens his own historical perspectives and leads him to conceive of the founder of Christianity as a world-historical tragic figure. In Berne he had much less sympathy for the figure of Jesus or insight into him. He did indeed warm to him as the teacher of a pure morality. But even here, as we pointed out in the previous chapter, he placed him beneath Socrates. This comparison, so unfavourable to Jesus, sprang originally from Hegel's overall view at this time. Jesus as teacher educates his disciples away from the life of society, each is encapsulated m his individuality, whereas Socrates leads his disciples back into activity in public life.

However great the differences between the Christianity of Jesus himself and Christianity as it later developed they nevertheless both remain private religions. It is for this reason that the original band of disciples has such a definitely 'positive' character in Hegel s eyes. This is expressed even in the number of disciples which Hegel regards as itself a symptom of fettshism .6

The source of the 'positivity' inherent m the teachings and activity of Jesus himself was to be found, according to Hegel, in the circumstance that Jesus always and as a matter of principle addressed to himself to the individual and, equally as a matter of principle, ignored the problems of society as such. This can be seen precisely m his attacks on wealth, inequality, etc., where he puts forward views that one would expect Hegel to approve of , but which he——quite consistently——rejects on account of their asocial character. He speaks, for instance, of the famous incident of the rich youth:

'"If thou wouldst be perfect, go, sell that thou hast and give it to the poor", Christ says to the youth. This image of perfection which Christ proposes contains the proof that his teachings were concerned primarily with the education and perfection of the individual man and they make it very clear how little such teachings are capable of being extended to society as a whole——

This brings us to the second historical question posed by Hegel. What had forced Christianity to become 'positive' in Hegel's sense? It was the process by which moral precepts intended only for the individual and envisagmg only his perfection were extended in the course of time to entire societies. Hegel distinguishes three phases in this development. There is, firstly, the teaching of Jesus and his relation to his immediate

disciples. Secondly, we fmd the Christian sect that grew up after his execution and m which the seeds of the 'positivity' already implanted began

to germinate, turning what was mtended as the moral union of the first community of Christians into a religious sect with pronounced 'positive' alien and inimical to life acquire that fateful importance that will determine the entire history of the Middle Ages and modern times.

elements. Finally, we see these doctrines spreading throughout society, Christiamty as a dominant church in which the forces of positivity so

It is obvious that this scheme is incomparably more historical than Hegel's conception of the Greek polis. It is of interest to note that Hegel relied heavily here on Rousseau's idea of the qualitative changes produced m democracies by a quantitative mcrease. In the section on democracy (Le Contrat Social, Bk. 3, chapter IV) Rousseau points out that mere quantitative expansion can prove dangerous and even fatal to a democracy. It is very characteristic that although these remarks refer directly to the democraoes of antiquity m Rousseau, they are applied only to Chnstianity by Hegel. Moreover, we should note the far from insignif icant shif t m emphasis whereby the cause of the decline is no longer an internal dialectic within the democracies themselves, as in Rousseau, but

the growth of private morality, and the application to a larger society of the ethical precepts binding upon individuals. The increase m the size of society, then, produces in the wake of quantitative change, qualitatively different forms of positivity. (We withess here the first, as yet very primitive, schematic and unconscious form of the transition from quantity into quality in Hegel. It is also of interest to note that this Rousseauan idea reappears, in a generalized, modif ied form, in the context of political and constitutional problems, e.g., in Jhe Encyclopaedia 10!!, Addition.)

Thus Hegel proceeds from the assumption that the later, terrible sides

of Christianity were

'already implicit in its earliest, undeveloped scheme——and were then exploited and extended by autocrats and hypocrites'.

And generalizing from this headds that the Christian religion

'provides us with yet another instance of the many which go to show that when the institutions and laws of a small society, where every citizen has the right to belong or not to belong, are extended to civil society at large, then they are always inappropriate and incompatible with civic freedom. '8

Hegel then goes on to discuss in great detail the vanous modif ications to the particular doctrines and precepts of Jesus in the origmal com-mumty, and to show how m the fully-grown Christian church they developed mto a consummate positivity and a hypocritical despotism. The detail of his analysis is explicable in terms of the state of Germany at the time; we are well aware from Hegel's letters of the use to which a reactionary orthodoxy put Kant's philosophy. Of course, even these studies do not make Hegel's early wntmgs 'theological*——since their mam thrust is anti-theological. Nevertheless, the history of the corruption of particular Christian doctnnes has no very great interest for us today. We shall confine ourselves therefore to a description of the main line of the historical development. And here we must again emphasize that for Hegel the quantitative expansion of the Christian community was bound up with the emergence of social and economic distinctions within it, i.e. that here too Hegel's central historical preoccupation, the inequality of wealth, plays a crucial role. Thus with the growth of the community, the original close union and brotherly feelings evaporated. In the same way the fact that the community comes increasingly to be formed from a number of socially and economically divergent strata spells the end of communal property. The ongmal rule that property should be held only in common with others

'ceases to be the condition for admission . . . all the greater is the emphasis on voluntary contributions to the communal treasury as a way of buying one's way into heaven. . . . The clergy could only gain by this since it recommended generosity to the laymen while taking good care not to throw away ib own possessions, and so in order to enrich the poor and needy, i.e. itself, it reduced the other half of mankind to beggary.'

In a similar fashion, the original emphasis on equality became transformed mto a 'positive' religious dogma:

'This theory was indeed retained undiminished—-except for the prudent corollary that equality existed in the eyes of heaven and so no further notice need he taken of it on earth.'

All the customs and ceremonies of Christianity became 'positive', i.e. inhuman comedies which hypocritically disregarded the real condition of the people entangled in them. Thus Holy Communion originally represented the departure of the teacher from his disciples and then became transformed into a celebration m memory of the beloved teacher, now dead, a ceremony in which the equality and fraternity of the disciples was the decisive moral and religious factor.

'But as Chnstianity became more widespread, a greater inequality among the Christians became prevalent, which although repudiated m theory was retained in practice, so that a fraternity m any real sense soon ceased to exist. '9

Thus in every sphere Christianity developed into a 'positive' church and transformed the original private morality of its progenitor into that dogmatic sanctimoniousness which in Hegel's view is the form of religion necessary for and appropnate to a society based on private interests, to a bourgeois society.

There is only one way out of this impasse: the revival of the freedom and self-activation of man characteristic of the Greeks. We have already referred to the way the imperialist interpreters of Hegel's early work triumphantly point to his thorough study of Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History. But even this cannot be twisted into an argument supporting the thesis of an early theological phase. For Hegel steadfastly refused to contemplate any religious, Christian, solution to the problem of Christian 'positivity', dismissing such hopes as doomed from the outset. He had obviously read the history of the later sectarian movements, and it was this that led him to his negative conclusions. In fact, it is with reference to Mosheim's work that we find him discussing the fate of those men who appear from time to time and endeavour to put an end to the dead 'positivity' of Christianity by reverting to its original morality. Of the fate that awaits such endeavours he remarks:

'If they did not keep their faith to themselves, then they became the founders of a sect which, where it was not condemned by the Church. gained a following and as it flowed further and further from its original source nothing but the rules and laws of its founders survived. These rules then ceased to be laws inspired by freedom and degenerated into mere ecclesiastial statutes—and this in turn brought about the foundation of yet other sects . . . no

Thus the positivity of Christiamty with all its catastrophic effects cannot be overcome so long as it rests on that form of human society to which Christianity owes its dif fUsion and its hegemony.

Hegel's early writings contain very detailed descriptions of the way all moral problems are distorted by Christianity and are transformed into hypocrisy and subservience to despotism. We shall not concern ourselves here with his discussions of purely individual moral problems, but shall address ourselves instead to his critique of the effects of Christianity upon public life, the state and history.

The most revealing and the most incisive comments are to be found in the passages immediately following his extracts from Gibbon's Decline andFall. Hegel says there:

'The first Chrisuans found consolation and the hope of future rewards for themselves and retribution for their enemies——their oppressors who worshipped idols. But the subject of a monastery, or indeed of any autocratic state cannot appeal to his religion to avenge him on a gluttonous prelate or a financier getting fat on the sweat of the poor, smce such men too hear the same mass, and indeed read it themselves, etc.——Instead he derives so much solace, so much compensation for the utter loss of his human rights in a mechanical religion that in his animality he loses all sense of his own humanity ...

'Under the Roman Emperors the Christian religion was incapable of hindering the decay of every virtue, the suppression of the freedoms and rights of the Romans, the tyranny and cruelty of the governors, the decline of genius and of all the arts and all the basic sciences. Nor was it able to bring new life to the melancholy mind, to the withered branches of national happiness and national virtue. But eroded and poisoned by the universal plague, and with its own servants deformed into the instruments of despotism, it made the decadence of the arts and sciences, obedience to despousm and a passive tolerance of the destruction of every fine flower of humanity and freedom, into a veritable system: it became the advocate, the most passionate glorif ier of the most scandalous iniquities of despotism and, what is even worse than any individual crimes, it went so far as to adulate despotism which drained all human energies dry and undermined humanity with its slow secret poison. '11

This gloomy picture of the historical impact of Christianity is meant to refer not only to Rome in its decline, but also the entire span of medieval and modern history. Discussing the historical achievements of the Christian religion elsewhere, he says:

'How unsuccessful it was in mastering the corruption of all classes, the barbarity of the ages and the coarse prejudices of peoples. When opponents of the Christian religion who, their hearts full of human , feelings, contemplate the history of the Crusades, the discovery of America, the contemporary slave-trade——and not merely these outstanding episodes in which Christianity in part performed greatly to its credit, but the whole chain of princely corruption and popular depravity——their hearts will certamly bleed at the sight. And when they compare this with the claims of the teachers and servants of religion to excellence, general utility and so forth——they must surely be filled with bitterness and hatred of the Christian religion ...'”

In like fashion Hegel discusses the influence of the Christian religion through every period of history and in every sphere of its activity. He repeatedly shows, e.g., that it is just those countries where the influence of the Church is greatest (such as the Papal States or Naples) that are the most corrupt, socially and politically, in the whole of Europe. His recurrent accusation against the Church is summed up in the following lapidary sentence:

'The Church has taught men to scorn civic and political freedom as filth m comparison with the rewards of heaven and the enjoyment of life.'13

Thus throughout its long period of rule, Christianity has procured the debasement of all real humanity. It has become the chief pillar of all autocratic caprice, of every sinister reaction. And Hegel is not thinking of isolated abuses, of the excesses of corrupt lay or spiritual rulers. The effects of Christianity spring directly from its very heart: from its positivity.

We have already seen from Hegel's earlier comparison of the wretchedness of Christian morality with the heroic ethic of classical antiquity how Christiamty as the religion of private life, of private interests, concerned exclusively with individuals, must necessarily destroy all the high virtues of the Greeks and Romans. It creates a view of life in which all heroism or self-sacr.if ice appears ridiculous. A man preoccupied only with his own property will inevitably think that self-sacrif ice for the commonweal is mere fully." And even the more subtle, spiritual satisfactions of individualism are dismissed by Hegel as the expressions of philistine egoism. A good instance of this is his view of all belief in the immortality of the soul, of eternal bliss. We may remind the reader that Hegel argued that smce the republicans of antiquity thought of their lives as merging entirely with the fortunes of the community, they neither needed nor sought after personal immortality.

The foundation of such heroism was, as we nave seen, the selfactivation of the people in the city-state. We have already pointed out that Hegel thought of these repubhcs as classless societies. In contrast to this he discerns a close connection between Christianity and the classstratification of society. In particular, he thinks of the priesthood as a particular class. This stratification——Hegel occasionally compares the priesthood to the guilds——is connected in its turn to all the material and spiritual interests of society. We have seen that Hegel believed that the change from property owned in common to the egoistic enrichment of the monasteries was part of an mexorable process. Elsewhere he explams in detail about the self-activation of a people not yet divided into classes, contrasting this with the Christian priesthood whom he regards as the 'repository of myths 'I5 and the monopolists of religious truth. This monopoly is a means by which the priesthood maintains its own hegemony and lends its support to the secular rules of the world. And the fact that the myths and legends of Christianity are alien to the peoples of Europe increases both the power of their monopoly and also its illiberal character in Hegel's eyes.

Thus men live beneath the yoke of the positive religion of Christianity in a society that confronts them as something unalterably 'given' and wholly alien. We may sum up Hegel's view of the historic mission of posiuve Christianity by saying that it breaks man's will to live a creative life in a society of free men. For this reason he expresses his opinion of the social function of Christiamty in these terms:

'It was revealed in the very divinity proclaimed by the Christian religion, a divinity beyond the reach of our power and our will, though not of our pleas and our prayers——the realization of a moral idea could henceforth only be desired (for what we desire, we cannot achieve ourselves, we wait to receive it without our own intervention)——it could no longer be willed. It was this hope of a revolution to be brought about by a divine Being, while men are reduced to the role of passive onlookers, that inspired the first Christian missionaries——and when this hope finally faded people were content to wait for a revolution at the end of the world. '16

The young Hegel's hatred and contempt for positive religion and for Christianity evidently have their roots in his enthusiasm for the Revolution. Since he puts an idealistic interpretation on the Revolution, regarding it as the realization of the 'practical reason' conceived as a social theory, the question of will must inevitably become of the first importance for him. For the will is, as we have seen, not merely the principle of praxis, it is the Absolute itself. Everything depends on will. As ,

long as men had willed freely, the classical republics had survived in all their glory. When Christianity transformed the free, active will into humble, passive desire, it opened the door to despotism. Of course, Hegel realized that there were socio-historical reasons for the change from will to wish, to desire. But since he was a German——and in Germany (even if there had been far fewer idealist illusions and prejudices)

there were no visible objective forces that might have brought about a democratic revolution——his utopian revolutionary hopes were forced to narrow themselves down to an over-enthusiastic, over-exaggerated emphasis on the will.

From this idealist perspective the pnme mover of the histoncal process could only be religion. It is for this reason that Hegel sees positive religion as the most important obstacle to the liberation of man. It becomes a monster which makes him cry out, like Voltaire, 'Ecrasez l'infame!'. And it is this that enables him to sum up his views on religion and its role in history as follows:

'In this way the despotism of the Roman rulers had banished the spirit of man from the earth, the rape of freedom had forced man's eternal, absolute spmt, to seek refuge in God——the misery it spread forced him to seek and to expect to ffnd his happmess in heaven. The objectivity of the Deity increased in direct proportion to the increase in the corruption and slavery of man, and this objectivity is in reality no more than a revelation, a manifestation of this spirit of the age ... The spirit of the age was revealed m the objectivity of its God when . . . it was mtroduced into a world alien to us, in a realm in

which we had no share, where we could not acquire a place through

our activity, but at most by begging or conjuring our way in; it was an age when man was a Non-ego and his God was another Non-

ego.... In such an age the Deity sheds all its subjectivity and

becomes nothing but object; and the inversion of all moral precepts is

easily and logically justif ied by theory. . . . This is the system of every

Church. .. .’I"7

At this decisive point of his attack on Christianity the influence of Georg Forster is at its greatest, being perceptible even in points of style. Thus Hegel had copied the expression 'begging one's way in' (hineinbetteln) and used it in a similar context to Forster himself.

We shall now, in conclusion, draw attention to one further aspect of Hegel's cnuque of Chnstiamty: the question of reconciliation with reality. This is important above all became it reveals the contrast between the early and the later Hegel in an extreme fashion. Hegel repeatedly returns to the subject and m the most scathing tones. We shall cite only a few of the most characteristic passages.

'In the womb of a mankind so corrupt that it must surely condemn itself by any moral criteria . . ., it was only natural to conceive and to welcome the doctnne of the corrupthess of human nature. This doctnne . . . satisfied pride by placing blame elsewhere and by providing a reason for pride even in the feeling of degradation itself; it gave honour to what is shameful, and by turning everything that might give us cause to believe in any active force into a sin, it sanctif ied and perpetuated every sort of weakness.，18

And elsewhere:

'But when Christianity found a way into the increasingly degenerate upper classes, when great distinctions between the noble and the mean began to arise within it, when despotism pmsoned all the wells of life and existence, then the age revealed the whole vapidity of its nature by the turn it gave to its conceptions of the divimty of God and its disputes about it; and it revealed its shame all the more clearly for attemptmg to conceal it beneath an aura of sanctity and exaltmg it as the greatest glory of mankind. *19

And finally:

'A people in this mood must welcome a religion which exalts the dommant spirit of the age, its moral impotence, the dishonour it endures through being trodden underfoot; such a religion is sanctif ied in the name of "passive obedience" which makes it appear as honour and the lof tiest virtue,——an operation by means of which men might gaze m wonder and pleasure at the transformation of the contempt of others and their own sense of disgrace into pride and peace of mind.一'a>

It was necessary to document these views so thoroughly to enable readers conversant with his later development to see the great divergence from his earlier position on this issue. We are aware that 'reconciliation' with reality is one of the cruxes of his later philosophy of history, even though we must of course interpret it in the dialectical sense outlined by Engels in his essay on Feuerbach. No doubt, Hegel's mature position in relation to historical reality is full of internal contradictions, and we shall have occasion to discuss them later when we come to examine the origins of his later view during his crisis in Frankfurt and after that in Jena. But the dialectical core of this view is always the recogmtion of social reality as it actually is; this remains true even though this reality is, naturally, no more than a stage, a moment in the historical process, a reality which, no less naturally, is destined to be transformed into non-reality, non-being, to be abolished and preserved [aujgehoben ]. Accordingly, for the later Hegel, the various philosophical systems must inevitably appear as historically necessary summations of the age in thought. This later conception is premised on a view of history m which there is a continuous dialectical process from the beginnings of mankind down to the present.

For the later Hegel 'reconciliation' is a category expressing the idea that the objective course of history is independent of the moral aspirations and evaluations of the men active within it. The vanous philosophies, ideologies, religions, etc., appear correspondingly as intellectual syntheses of a particular historical era. For this reason, Hegel rejects all purely moral evaluations of them. This is not to say that he abstains from any point of view. But his chief critenon is the progressiVe or reactionary nature of a particular period and not, as earlier on, 1ts relation to an eternal, supra-histoncal morality. To this extent 'reconciliation' is an index of the great development m Hegel's historical sense .

But the development is highly contradictory. For his use of the category also points to a real reconciliation with the most retrograde tendencies of the past and present. In particular, it tacitly accepts the reactionary institutions of contemporary Germany and this leads to the abandonment of all conflict, and of all real criticism, especially with regard to Christianity. Hence, the historical and sCientif ic advance on the moral indignation of his Berne Period exacts a great price in terms of his progressive outlook.

As yet Hegel can see no objectiVe historically necessary roadleading to the 'real' present. The real present for him is the great miracle of the French Revolution, the apparent revival of the democratic freedom of antiquity. And between antiquity Itself and its revival m the future, there stretches the corrupt, decadent age of despotism, oppression and 'positive' religion. Hegel does indeed perceive the historical necessity that gave birth to positive religion, but he does not discern any real histoncal forces active in it which might lead by an internal dialectic to a revival of classical civilization. (It 1s revealing that we do not possess a single note dating from Hegel's early period which attempts to come to grips with the real causes of the French Revolution.)

His exaggerated expectations and longings for a revolutionary regeneration of mankind do not permit him to develop a satisfactory methodological basis for his philosophy of history, one which could explain the road from the past to the present and future in terms of its own dialectic. For this reason, the regeneration of classical freedom remains a mere postulate, an abstraction of which his passionate hatred of Christianity whose manifestations we have already seen, was the necessary, orgamc complement. This hatred has its source in Hegel's view of freedom and other moral concepts as eternal, supra-histoncal categories. In his opinion, Christianity violates these eternal truths, perverts them, and invests what is base and eternally iniquitous with an aura of false sanctity. It is at this perversion of moral concepts that Hegel directs his entire revolutionary hatred.

It would be an error to interpret Hegel's increasing maturity simply in terms of an advance m his opimons. It goes without saying that there is a tremendous progress in that respect, above all in the philosophy of historv. His verv abandonment of the revolutionary ideals of his vouth enabled him to develop into the leading exponent of German idealism; it enabled him to achieve such a profound and true insight mto the necessity of the histoncal process and the methodology of history that he even went beyond what was possible within the framework of idealism. But a price had to be paid, and the fact that this matunty could only be achieved at the cost of renouncmg the goals of a democratic revolution is a grim indication of the tragic conflict imposed on Hegel by the backward socio-economic state of Germany. Marx and Engels have repeatedly pointed out how the greatest Germans of this period succumbed m this constant battle agamst the German 'misere', and how even a giant such as Goethe could alternate 'between the colossal and the petty'.:!l Nor was Hegel more successful at avoiding this fate. And when we pursue the further development of his views to the point where his idealist dialectic culmmates m a magnif icent unif ied method, we cannot avoid reflecting upon the disharmony of German history which force Hegel also to alternate 'between the colossal and the petty'.

### CHAPTER 6 The place of 'positivity' in the development of Hegel's thought

Our previous deliberations have endeavoured to map out the frontiers of Hegel's early philosophy of history. Our present task is to establish briefly the philosophical signif icance of Hegel's central concepts at this period. We shall not attempt at this stage to subject them to any thorough-going criticism. For the time being we shall be content to trace the main lines of his development up to the point where they first crystallize out in a historically signif icant form in The Phenomenology of Mind. Only then will it be possible, necessary and instructive to make an assessment of the intrinsic value of the dialectics developed by Hegel. Only then will it be worth our while to compare it with materialist dialectics and try to reach any judgment about the historical contribution and philosophical limitations of this climactic point of idealist dialectics. Until then we shall keep our study for the most part within the limits laid down by Hegel itself, i.e. we shall endeavour to establish what sorts of questions and answers were influential at subsequent, more mature stages in the development of the Hegelian dialectic. It would no doubt be relatively simple to subject all the concepts prominent even at this stage to an exhaustive materialist critique. But on the one hand, Hegel himself overcomes certain errors and extremes, certain undialectical features in his early thought, and on the other hand there are a number of idealist weaknesses that are never overcome and survive throughout all the phases of his development. In either case, to plunge straight into detailed criticisms would inevitably involve us in wearisome repetitions.

We have observed that the philosophically and historically crucial concept of Hegel's thought in this period is that of positivity. In the highest form yet established by Hegel, in the confrontation between subjective self-activation and freedom on the one hand, and dead objectivity on the other, positivity contains the seeds of a problem that will prove central to the later development of the dialectic: viz. the problem he was later to designate by the term 'externalization' (Entausserung) and which, in the context of his later, much more comprehensive and systematic ideas, contains the entire problem of the nature of objects (Gegenstand-lichkeit) in thought, nature and in history. We need only remmd ourselves that in his later philosophy the whole of nature is conceived as an externalization of mind, of spirit.

At this point, however, Hegel has not conceived the problem m epistemological terms. Even though he occaswnally makes use of Fichte's terminology and applies the expression 'non-ego' to men and the God of Christianity, this should not be taken to imply that he simply accepts Fichte's theory of knowledge. He merely uses the expression as an image for a social and moral condition of man. And he is just as casual in the use he makes of Kantian categories. What interests him chiefly, one might almost say, exclusively, at this period, is the mtual interaction between social praxis and moral and religious ideologies. What is very characteristic of this phase, however, is the way he always treats the subject of this social praxis as collective, but without making any attempt to clarif y the nature of this subject or to define it more precisely. Anyone familiar with his later thought will realize at once that this subject turns into 'spirit' (Geist) and that his system, founded on logic and the philosophy of nature, advances from subjective spirit through objective spirit to its crowning pinnacle m absolute spirit. In Berne and even in Frankfurt there is no real sign of such an elaborate system. The first verswn of this line of development does not make its appearance until The Phenomenology f Mind. In Berne his immediate interest is histoncal: he wishes to trace the actual historical path, the real fate of this collective subject (i.e. of the incarnation of the contmmty of the development of society as it appears in an idealist, mystif ied form). The fact that the resulting histon-cal account is an abstract idealist construct is by the way; what is more important, indeed of the very highest signif icance, is that in the course of his studies he arrives at the concept of positivity, of objectivity.

The insight he gamed was the idea that the actual objectivity, the independent existence of objects apart from human reason, could be conceived as the product of the development and activity of that very same reason. He comes close here to the motif s that will be fully developed in his mature dialectics and at the same time, he firmly erects the frontiers of his own idealism, frontiers he will never be able to transcend. This second moment is at once comprehensible to any matenalist and m Part IV we shall discuss at length the profound criticisms which Marx levelled at the idealist limitations of Hegel's whole philosophy. For the ongms of the Hegelian dialectic, however, it is the first moment that is decisive, although it is of course inextncably intertwmed with the limitations implied by the second. It contains the idea that the entire development of society together with all the ideological formations which it creates in the course of history are the product of human activity itself, a manifestation of the self-production and reproduction of society. With the aid of this idea German idealism succeeds in transcending certain—no less idealist—limitations of the historical approach found in mechanical materialism. Essentially, the latter was able to incorporate only the everpresent natural conditions of any society (the climate, etc) mto its view of history, while, on the other hand, it confined its study of human praxis to the scrutiny of those visible or palpable reasons that determme the actions of individual men. Engels emphasized the great superiority of Hegel's philosophy of history over his predecessors (with reference to its later formulation):

'On the other hand, the philosophy of history, particularly as represented by Hegel, recognizes that the ostensible and also the really operating motives of men who act in history are by no means theultimate causes of historical events; that behind these motives are other motive powers, which have to be discovered. But it does not seek these powers in history itself, it imports them rather from outside, from philosophical ideology, into history.，J

This critical insight into Hegel's philosophy of history must be modif ied to apply to his early thought by pointmg out that there the idealist errors bulk even larger while only the ffmt signs of his later momentous discoveries are in evidence.

But the first signs are indubitably there. On the one hand, m his emphasis on the social character of the motive forces of history (however much he mystif ies them idealistically), and on the other hand, in the circumstance that even for the early Hegel the heart of history was the history of human freedom. The positivity of religion contained what was no doubt a very general conception of objectivity; but at the same time it was essentially the result of an historical development, with an historical beginning and presumably a conceivable end, and so it was the startingpoint for an historical dialectic of freedom^an authentic discovery despite its highly abstract and idealist form. In the thought of the Berne penod, Hegel saw the historical process as possessmg a single great tna-dic structure: I) the original freedom and self-activation of human society—z) the loss of this freedom under the hegemony of positivity—3) the recovery of the lost freedom. The similarity to the idealist dialectics of Rousseau's interpretation of history is evident.

Hegel focuses his analysis of the loss and recovery of freedom on the workings of the process in religion. The lifeless inhuman and anti-human character of objectivity, of positivity obtains its highest expression in the Christian religion. On the other hand, despite all Hegel's efforts to provide social and economic explanations, religion remains in his view the ultimate cause of a state of society and of a relationship between man and his environment which is unworthy of man himsel£ Hence to comprehend and shake of f the yoke of despotism means primarily to rid oneself of this positivity. It means liberatmg man from a religion whose objects are transcendental, other-wordly for him. For this reason Hegel requires philosophy to provide a theory that will expose and destroy the otherworldly objectivity of positivity and will reconvert all objectivity into

self-acnvatmg subjectivity.

'Setting aside a few earlier attempts, it has become the privilege of our age at least in theory to reclaim as the property of man all the treasures previously thrown away on heaven . . . '2

In this and similar statements we see a philosophical tendency emerging that has a defimte affinity with Feuerbach. This affimty was first observed m the i85o's by the Liberal Hegel scholar, Rudolf Haym, who also drew attention to one difference between the two men, in the course of which he nevertheless failed to remark on the great superionty of Feuerbach's matenalism over Hegel's early thought. He says:

'According to Feuerbach, the true essence of God is the essence of man; according to Hegel, the true essence of God is the essence of perfected politics. '3

Haym's own philosophical development belongs to the period before 1 848; m his youth he experienced the dissolution of Hegelianism and the powerful influence of Feuerbach. For this reason he had at least a glim-menng of msight mto the real situation and, unlike the neo-Hegelians of the Age of lmperialism, he did not consciously stnve to distort and falsif y history. Of course, it is true that he only emphasized the strong side of Hegelian philosophy m his comparison with Feuerbach and neglected to mention the other, materialist side which would redress the balance. It is also true that Feuerbach's critique of religion is not without its weak, idealist elements to which Engels has drawn attention in no uncertam manner. According to Engels,

'Feuerbach by no means wishes to abolish religion; he wants to perfect it. Philosophy itself must be absorbed into religion.，4

However, Feuerbach's ideological failings must not be allowed to blind us to the superiority of his mechamcal materialism in the crucial questions of epistemology which exercised an important influence on the crinque of religion. This remams true even though Feuerbach himself may not have taken his theones to their logical conclusion.

The supenority of matenalism can be seen m the very concept of positivity so crucial for the early Hegel. It is no accident that it should have been Feuerbach who aimed his annihilating attacks at Hegel's later, much more developed and thought-out view of positivity, viz. against his concept of 'externalizanon'. The early Marx always acknowledged Feuerbach's achievements here and he continued and extended what was valuable in Feuerbach. This is a question that we shall have to return to in detail in Part IV. Here it must suffice to pomt out that m Feuerbach the objects of nature are held to be mdependent of human consciousness. Therefore, when Feuerbach dissolves the concept of God mto anthropology, when he declares that the God of the religions was made by man m his own image, this does not cause him to abandon objectivity (as it doesHegel), but instead it leads him to reaffirm real objectivity, the existence of the external world independently of human conscwusness. Such a view will alone be capable of really dissolving the ideas of religwn. For only this will clearly reveal their selfappointed, illusory, false objectivity for what it really is. Only the clear contrast with the real objectivity of the external world can expose the falsity, the hollowness and emptiness of the objects of religion. And if , as Engels has so rightly observed, Feuerbach was unable to take his materialist abolition of religion to Its logical conclusion, his materialist approach nevertheless suggests a method for the philosophical demolition of religious ideas.

It follows that the so-called anthropological approach to the criticism of religwn, viz. the demonstration that religious conceptions arc only projections, apparent objectif ications of wnat man thinks, feels and wishes, can never be more than one constituent of an authentic maten-alist critique. Lenin saw this weakness very clearly:

'This is why the term the "anthropological principle" in philosophy used by Feuerbach and Chcrnyshevsky is so narrow. Both the anthropological principle and naturalism are only inexact, weak descriptions of materialism. * 5

With this Lemn draws attention to the weaknesses of Feuerbach's philosophy and cnticizes them with his wonted incisiveness. Over and above that he provides a larger framework for the critique of the anthropological principle wherever it makes its appearance in the context of idealist philosophy.

This is what happens m Hegel's early works. Haym makes the senous error of completely abstracting the anthropological principle from materialism and idealism, whereas in the context of idealism it would gain a whole new dimension. For idealism there is no world of objects mdepen-dent of consciousness. For the idealist the true objectivity of the objects of the external world and the false pseudo-objects of religious ideas all move on the same plane. Both are the product of an idealistically mystif ied subject——and it is of very little importance whether the idealist thinks in terms of the real consciousness of the mdividual, or of a mystif ied collective of 'umversal', 'supra-human' consciousness. It follows, then, that if the idealist wishes to attribute reality to an object in the external world, he cannot deny the same reality to the objects of religion. Conversely, if , like Hegel in his dealings with positive religion, he should attempt to dissolve the objects of religion, he thereby does ,

away entirely with the real objectivity of the real world and reintegrates it in a 'creative subjectivity'. This is the fate that befell not only the early philosophy of Hegel, but also the entire late phase of classical German philosophy. Both Schelling and Hegel——each m his own way——strove to escape from the impasse of mystical solipsism, of the subjective idealism of Fichte, by posiung a mystical identical subject--object which would externalize the objective world and then reintegrate it m itself.

In Hegel's early work this method was not yet fully developed, but the nucleus, the tendency, was already present. And this basic assumption deffnes the idealist limitations and misconceptions mherent m his application of the anthropological pnnciple to the cntique of religwn. This principle has long existed 11 rudimentary form. It can be found in the Greek philosophers and occurs frequently m the writings of the French Enlightenment. Therefore, when Hegel attempts to analyse the religious ideas of a penod as the projections of the modes of existence prevalent in them, when he attempts to establish a close correlation between religious forms and forms of life, his achievement can have no claim to onginality. So far from that being the case, we may even believe the anthropological principle to be weakened by his idealist assumptions, weakened to a much greater extent than by the old-style materialists whom Lenin rightly cnticized. The distinction may be summarized m this way: for all the weaknesses that may occur in the use of the anthropological principle by materialists of whatever persuasion, they always adhere to the idea of clear and unambiguous causality: it is man who creates his God (or idea of God). In Hegel's philosophy, however, we discover a strange, confused interaction. On the one hand, a causal view is to be found in rudimentary form: the freedom and self-activation of the democratic Greek people gave birth to the serene world of the Olympian gods; the mdig-nity and debasement of life under late Roman despotism gave birth to the positive religion of Christianity, etc. At the same time, however, we also ffmd the opposite: the gods enter the arena of world history as real actors, freedom is not merely the origm of the Olympian gods. but also their gif t to mankind; Christianity not only sprmgs from the moral decadence of a people governed by tyrants, but equally tyranny is an effect brought about by the Christian religion.

Hegel is never able to free himself from the half-light of this position on the philosophy of religion. Not only in The Phenomenology of Mind, but also in his discussions of religious problems in his very last writings we come across this same confused ambigmty, which as he grows older leads to an even more willing acceptance of the pseudo-objective status of religion. In his youth Hegel desired passionately to destroy the Christian religion. But his anti-religious struggles were at all Urnes vitiated by the quite central failing that he wished to replace one faith with another, to substitute for positive Christianity the non-positive religwn of the Greeks.

Thus religion js made into an indispensable element of human life, and of the entire course of history. History is not for Hegel a process m which man emancipates himself from religious conceptions which he had taken over from primeval Urnes and which for thousands of years have undergone various transformations corresponding to the changes m society. History is rather the process of religious change, or, to put it in the language of objective idealism: it is the history of God's metamorphoses. And once idealism has arnved at this pomt——which in the case of the young Hegel is true only to a very limited extent——the history of God will necessarily become one of the most important moments of history itself. In that event, all counter-tendencies flowing from the anthropological cnucism of religious ideas, however correct in themselves, will be obscured if not wholly overwhelmed by this idealist theological principle. Thus we can see the emergence in the young Hegel of a whole series of idealist tendencies which will prove fatal for the later consolidation of the Hegelian system. This realization, however, should not blmd us to those pnnciples in which the potent and true aspects of his historical dialectic also begm to stir m his early period. For, however misguided Hegel's confused conception of the interaction between man and God may be, it nevertheless represents an attempt to grapple with a very real problem, albeit one that can only be properly solved by dialectical materialism. This problem, which completely baffled Feuerbach and the other mechanical matenalists, is that of the historical ongms and histon-cal impact of religious ideas. And there can be no doubt——and every reader of the passages we have quoted from Hegel's early writings can easily convince himself of this——that Hegel both asked this question and struggled earnestly with it, even though it was not possible for him to arrive at a real solution or even a satisfactory statement of it.

While Marx was still m his youthful idealist phase, he paid some attention to this problem in his Dissertation——at an incomparably higher level of clarity than Hegel——but he too was unable to solve it. He states:

'The proof s of the existence of God are either nothing but empty tauto

logies——for mstance, the ontological proof asserts only: "what I really (realiter) conceive, is a real conception for me", i.e. it has an effect on

me, and in this sense all gods whether heathen or Christian have possessed a real existence. Did not old Moloch reallv rule? Was not the

the lives of the Greeks? Kant's criti-

Delphic Apollo a real power in cism is irrelevant here. '6

Marx could only put forward a satisfactory soluuon to this problem when he had gamed a clear msight into dialectical matenalism. Not until then could he expose the senselessness of religious ideas with a precision far greater than that of the most important mechanical matenalists who preceded him. At the same time, he could also show in concrete terms how the growth of the forces of production and the resulting changes m the relations of production led to the emergence of particular religious ideas m particular periods and how they then dominated the emotional and intellectual life of men.

What is important and mterestmg in the philosophically so confused posiuon of the early Hegel is that he poses the question of the concrete historical effects of religion. The Enlightenment attacked Chrisuanity and did so in a more radical and intelligent manner than Hegel. But it was hardly able to pose this question, let alone answer it. And even Feuerbach does not really, m all senousness, enquire why of all religions it was Christianity that became dominant m the West. Feuerbach accepts this fact just as a fact, and then goes on to deduce Christianity from the , abstract 'nature' of an equally abstract man, simply from the nature 'of man'. Now such an argument can do no more than explain the birth of religious ideas in general, but it cannot explain the birth let alone the historical development of specific religious ideas.

Hegel intervenes at just this pomt. The quotation from Haym, reproduced earlier on, touches on Hegel's mam achievement here: he sees the problem of the origms of religion as not merely historical, but also, and inseparably from this, as social. History for Hegel is the history of human social activity. His social analysis is no doubt very primitive, the socioeconomic categories he applies are doubtless naive, misconceived and artif icial, and his explanations are still full of prejudices derived from Kant and the Enlightenment. (Examples are the belief that the state of society depends on whether the government is good or bad, after the manner of the Enlightenment, or the over-estimation of the social importance of purely moral problems typical of Kant.) Nevertheless, his view signals a real advance m the methodology of the study of the rise and fall of the religions. We see here how right Marx was in the Theses on Feuerbach when he argued that there was a connection between the old materialism and classical idealism in Germany. For Hegel's preoccupation with the social factors at work in religion is a striking instance of the 'active side' emphasized by Marx. And our earlier analysis also provides evidence for the other aspect of Marx's account of idealism, viz. the idea that in it this 'active side' can never be more than an abstract, ideological activity.

We have already pomted to one consequence of this inevitable abstracthess: Hegel's inability to direct his attack at religion per se. In the unconscious dialectic of his view of history there is a tendency to claim that only the positive religions are religions in the strict sense and so neither the religion of the Greeks nor the religious revival he expected really came within the definition. His polemic against the mhuman character of positive religion has in this context a much more defmite anti-religious bias than is usual in Hegel. Of course, he is prevented by

his idealism from taking it further. Thus positivity becomes an unstable, ambivalent concept. On the one hand, it expresses an extreme idealist repudiation of all objectivity; on the other hand, it contains faint indications of those sorts of objectif ication which Marx was later to call 'fetishism'. Of course, all this remains extremely confused and obscure in Hegel. Even his much later, more mature formulation of the problem, his conception of social objectif ication as 'externalization' fails to eliminate the obscunties. The reason for this lies, as we have suggested, in idealism itself. For if Marx is able clearlv to isolate the fetish-character of the commodity in all its 'ghostly objectivity', this is only possible because dialectical materialism was able to establish a clear definition of the real objective nature of objects and so eliminated all possible confusion between true objectivity and the objectivity of fetish objects. (The pomt here is to establish the philosophical distinction between idealism and materialism——it is obvious that Hegel, especially in his youth, did not have the nformation about economics at his disposal which would have enabled him to relate the fetish forms back to the concrete economic

structure of society.)

If it is true that what we discover in the early Hegel is only a highly

confused intuition, enveloped in a mystical fog, of certain important social and philosophical connecuons, it is no less true that this fact is of

endunng historical importance. The point is that there are two closely related impulses which will play a signif icant role in the later development of Hegels dialectic. I hese impulses are firstly, the belief that the whole of human history together with all the social formations that are born and pass away, are the product of human activity; [secondly,] that all these formations get out of the control of man and become autono-is very prominent in Hegel's concept of positivity. Positivity is by no means something introduced mto human history from outside. On the contrary, Hegel's historical sense is at its most developed precisely in his elaboration of this concept. The elements of Christianity which have the greatest pretensions to transcendence (an omnipotent God, revelation, miracles, etc.) are the very things which Hegel passionately reclaims as the products of an internal social process, admittedly one of break-up and decay. Positivity, the historical climax of man's social inactivity, of the abandonment of human digmty is, according to Hegel, the result of a necessary development of man's social activity.

mous powers with an objectivity of their own. We may remind ourselves of the way in which, in Hegel's view, Christianity develops into something essentially different from its founder's intentions. Moreover, this dialectic functions throughout the entire history of Chrisuanity. From our previous discussions it is very apparent that this second impulse

We must not proceed further in our discussmn without drawing attention once more to the idealist limitation of Hegel's world-view. We have seen that his efforts to translate his correct but indistinct intuitions

into a real knowledge of society all fail because his view of becomes entangled with a general theory of objecuvity. We s dialectic are inextricably intertwined with these weaknesses and that an historical study of the genesis of his dialectic has to try and disentangle the confusion. In the present case, the problem is that Hegel transforms the lifeless objectivity of positive religion into a social movement, mto a product of the social activity of human bemgs. This 1s the first step on the road to the dialectic with lts underlying idea of the transformation of all inert existence into movement. Of course, he still has a long way to go before this end is reached. For, in the first place, m his Berne penod such tendencies are confined entirely to social problems. There is as yet no hint of a more general application, to movement as such——which we find in the Logic. Our research mto Hegel's development of this theme will necessarily be imperfect. We must confine ourselves to his social attitudes and it would be very relevant to consider his scientif ic studies at this point since recent advances in science played a great role m his attempt to formulate more general laws of movement. At this point then a real understanding of Hegel's development will only become possible when the development of his scientif ic views is better known and can be integrated into the picture as a whole.

But even in the realm of societal categories Hegel is very far fromdeveloping his intuitions of a dialectical nexus, of the intellectual repro-duction of social objects as the products of human activity, and of theirdissolution in the movement of society, into a genune philosophica!method. The contrast between the periods he analyses is far too rigid andmetaphysical for that: in Greece all is self-activating and public, in Christianity all is passive and private. The world of the classical citoyen isstarkly contrasted with that ofthe modern bourgeois. And we can hardlyfind any awareness of the dialectic which perceives that the passivity ofmen in the Christian era is also a form of social activity. To say nothingof the fact that in every society the particular interests ofindividuals andindividual classes (Hegel speaks always of *Estates’[Stande]) are inter-twined in a dialectical, contradictory manner with public interests. Insubsequent chapters we shall attempt to trace in detail the changes inHegel's understanding of the dialectics ofsociety brought about by hisstudy ofpolitical economy. We shall also have to establish the inevitablelimitations of his thought in this respect, We may anticipate our conclu-sions with the general observation that the inadequacies of his under-standing ofthe dialectics of society and history spring not only from thegeneral limitations of his idealism, but also from the metaphysical tra-dition that he had inherited and which had marked him for life.

However, in these confused intuitions there are a number of themes that are important both intrinsically and also for his later development. Chief among these is the idea that a religion can only gain widespread control of men's minds if it is appropriate to the social conditions which gave birth to it or facilitated Its rise to power. Hegel thereby discredits theories which see religion as no more than the conscious deception of a people, and regards the impact of a religion as simply the consequence of the ongmal act of deception: in short he dispenses with the merely ideological interpretations of the Enlightenment. We have observed how this new standpoint does not make Hegel any more tolerant of Christianity. On the contrary, his discussions of the vanous kinds of hypocrisy and deception, which, in his view, derived necessarily from the nature of Christianity are indignant and satirical in tone. The advance here is to be seen precisely in the weight given to the idea that religions have a necessary existence and in his attempts to concretize his diagnosis of this fact. Thus he gives a number of examples of the way the original Christian communities, where a certain fraternal feeling and social equality had prevailed, gradually but mevitably gave way to hypocrisy with the rise of the universal church. the emergence of social and economic distinctions and the sanctioning of these distinctions by the church. On the other hand, Hegel constantly returns to the point that although the religious and moral tenets of Christianity conflict radically with truth, reason and the dignity of man, they are by that very fact in harmony with the social and moral climate of the age. He thus exposes the deception and hypocrisy in a much more historical, social and concrete manner than the abstract ideologists of the Enlightenment. Hegel does not deny that men were deceived by the priests, but this was only possible because the disruption of the society in which they lived and the moral degradation this brought in its train demanded just such a deception as the Christian priests were able to provide.

A further attempt at greater socio-historical concretization can be found in the central role assigned to the non-positive, non-objective character of the religion of the Greeks. Here, indeed, we can glimpse the strikingly contradictory character of his subjectivism and if its absurd implications do not come fully into the open this is due solely to his failure to develop his ideas to their logical conclusion. We are referring, of course, to the non-objectivity of the Greek world, the idea of a free, self-activating subjectivity which only creates objects till further notice so to speak; objects have no opportunity to attain true mdepen-dence of the subject, but are instead transformed back into subjectivity, recalled into the active subject, the people.

This conception of subjectivity will later play a crucial role in the Hegelian system. After all, one of the chief dialectical problems in The Phenomenology of Mind involves the transformation of substance into subject. His youthful conception of the Greeks contains the first germ of this idea. This is particularly true of 1ts revolutionary application to the present, to the dream of a class1cal revival, of the rediscovery of the free, creative activity of the people, the non-objectiv1ty of the world of objects in the epoch inaugurated by the French revolutwn. To use the language of the Phenomenology we arrive at this scheme: (a) the period of the subject that has not yet transformed itself mto substance—(b) subjectivity devoured by substance (positivity)——(c) reintegration of substance m the newly-awakened subject. Needless to say, this scheme is never stated so baldly in his early writings, but it is certainly implicit in his reconstructions of historv.

Of course, Hegel's later philosophy is by no means confined to the greater systematization, the dialectical clarif ication of the course of history: it also sets out to change our view of it radically. For the later Hegel, history no longer begins with the Greeks. This does not only refer to the fact that the history of the Onent comes within his purview (a trend which already begms in Frankfurt); it is also true philosophically. The course of history mcreasingly departs from its ongms in a Rous-seauesque tnad: freedom——loss of freedom——recovery of freedom. It is replaced by a much more evolutwnary conception of the general growth of the idea of freedom m the course of history: freedom for one man (onental despotism)——freedom for a few (classical antiquity)——freedom for all (Chnstianity and modern times). It would be a mistake to believe that Hegel's youthful view vanishes without a trace. On the contrary, highly modif ied and de-historicized, it underlies the system as it appears in the Encyclopaedia. The basic schema here is: logic (the self-activation of spint)——natural philosophy (the externalization of spirit)——philosophy of mind (the path of spint to perfect freedom, to the identical subject object, logic as the culmination of the philosophy of spirit).

But even apart from these far-reaching consequences, even apart from this subterranean existence of his first, not finally thought-out schema, his contradictory interpretatwn of classical Greece has other more concrete and histoncally more important consequences. In our cnuque of the weaknesses of Hegel's philosophy of religion, we pointed to the crucial defect that he does not repudiate or attack religion m itself, he merely confronts posiuve religion with a non-positive one. It was this factor that led to the great populanty of his early writmgs in the Age of Imperialism. We need hardly add that this popularity did not go beyond the frequent quotation of a number of particularly confused passages and certainly did not extend to the study of his whole early development. There can be no doubt, however, that alongside the so-called irrationalism of the early Hegel, this ethereal, aesthetic religion without either substance or dogma has played a very definite role. The reactionary ideologists of the Age of Impenalism, particularly before the First World War, very of ten did not venture openly to defend actual religions： yet at the same time they were eager to preserve and lend support to religion in general. Lenin had a clear insight into the great idealogical danger implicit in this trend. In a letter to Maxim Gorki, he wrote:

'A Catholic priest who rapes a girl . . . is far less of a threat to democracy than a priest without a surplice, a priest without any crude religion, an ideal and democratic priest who preaches the creation of a new god. For it is easy to expose the first priest, it is not hard to have him condemned and thrown out. But the second priest is not so easily dealt with——it is a thousand times harder to expose him and no "fragile and irresolute" petty-bourgeois will come forward to condemn him.""

However, this central failing of Hegel's early conception of religion has one historical aspect of great importance for his later development. This is the idea that Greek religion is not a religion in the same sense as the later positive religion of Christiamty. This belief leads Hegel to a concrete historical analysis of the nature of Greek civilization. And the more his interpretation of Greece frees itself from parallels with the present, and perspectives on the future, the more historical it becomes. That is to say, he comes increasingly to regard classical antiquity as something finally dead and buried, as a stage in the history of the spirit that has been definitely overcome. In the coming chapters, we shall show in detail how this change of view ts connected to changes in his attitude towards the present, the historical actuality of the Revolution and of a democratic republic in Germany. And so we shall see how these changes in their turn modif ied his entire philosophical system.

Here, it is enough to say that this particular view of Greece contains the seeds of his later arguments in the Aesthetics concerning the fate of the beautif ul in the course of human history. It is well known that m the later system Greek art is seen as the authentic objectif ication of the aesthetic principle. This is by no means a conclusion based on formal artistic considerations, but is orgamcally deduced from the analysis of Greek life as a whole. In all subsequent periods, as early as the age of Romanticism (which for Hegel means the Middle Ages and Renaissance) the aesthetic ceases to manifest itself in a pure form. The dominant principle of this era is religion, Christianity. And the march of the dialectic of mind beyond this latter stage no longer involves a return to the Greeks, but on the contrary, it heralds the dawn of spirit in its conceptual phase, and aesthetically, this means: the age of prose. Needless to say, the theoretical bases of this periodization are strongly ideological and highly idealistic. The most valuable of Hegel's aesthetic analyses are those which go beyond questions of principle and focus on the actual manifestations, the true objectif ications of Greek life in art. But we must not forget that for Hegel himself the idea that Greek religion was not truly religious provided a sort of key to an understanding of the special quality of Greek civilization, even 小 ough the discoveries he made went far beyond his idealist schema.

The tragic contradiction m Hegel's development becomes visible at this point too. As a German thinker at the turn of the nineteenth century he could only choose between utopian illusions and the resigned acceptance of the miserable reality of Germany as it then was. For Hegel Greek civilization could only be either, as in Berne, a Jacobin dream of the democratic regeneration of man, or else it had to be a golden age of beauty, now irrevocably lost, an orgamc human culture which could only be succeeded by the arid age of prose, a prose from which there is no escape. Hence man must simply accommodate himself to it and to gain an accurate conceptual understanding of it becomes the lof tiest task of philosophy. We know how Hegel's thought moved from one of these alternatives to the other, and in subsequent chapters we shall have the opportunity to study some of the main stages m his journey. We shall also come to understand that his dialectics were made possible only because he travelled along this road. The heroic Jacobins among his predecessors or contemporaries, men like Georg Forster or Holderlin, were destined to remain on the margins of the ideological development of Germany.

It is very mstructive m this context to glance briefly at the differences between Hegel's idealist dialectics and the materialist dialectics of Marx and Engels. Marx too places the Greeks in the very centre of his views on aesthetics; for him also Greek civilization represents the purest and most noble manifestation of human aesthetic activity hitherto. Marx is perfectly explicit about the normative character of classical art. After referring to the concrete historical conditions that made it possible, he goes on to say:

'But the dif ficulty is not that of understanding how Greek art and the epic poetry are associated with certain forms of social development. The dif ficulty is that they still give us aesthetic pleasure and are in certain respects regarded as a standard and an unattainable ideal. '8

Marx, too, places Greek beauty in sharp contrast to the prose of capitalism. And since he understands the nature of capitalism much more thoroughly than Hegel does even at the point of his greatest maturity, since his opposition to the capitalist system was much more entrenched and more solidly based scientif ically, his condemnation of capitalist culture was much more profound, more comprehensive and annihilating than Hegel's ever could be. And it follows that in Marx's case there could be no question of a resigned acceptance of the actual state of human culture such as we find in the later Hegel. The contemplation of the past and immortal beauty of Greece never becomes a reason for melancholy. His profound and comprehensive grasp of human history, of its true motive forces, of the real economic and social structure of capitalism led Marx beyond utopias to the scientif ic view of the regeneration of man through sooalism. In this perspective, the normative status of Greek art becomes a unique mheritance; in the era of liberation, at the end of man's 'pre-history', it will spur mankind on to build a culture that will surpass by far all the cultures of the past. Thus in his resolution of the Hegelian dilemma of utopia and resignation, Marx not only proves the supenonty of materialist over idealist dialectics, but also, even where he has learnt from Hegel, even where he salvages important elements of his thought, such ideas as he does take become completely remodelled in the course of their mtegrat10n mto a materialist dialectic.

For Hegel himself there could be no escape from this dilemma. Had he contmued to think along the lines of his early essays the fate of a Forster or Holderlin would have been unavoidable. The bnlliant but sporadic mstghts of his early writings m Berne could only mark a signif icant stage m the development of human thought because Hegel managed to go beyond the republican illusions of his first period. We have seen that all these begmnings, rudimentary and confused as they were, nevertheless pomted towards the dialectical approach to history. In Berne there could be no question of a thorough-gmng dialectical analysis of history—even within the limits of idealism. We can convince ourselves of this most easily by observing that at this stage there is absolutely no sign of the most important dialectical categories of his later method: immediacy and mediation, the dialectical interaction of the particular and the general, etc.,——all these are absent. There is only a rudimentary dialectical schema of the course of history, and even this is shot through with metaphysical concepts. And if Hegel does succeed for the most part in avoiding a rigid metaphysical posinon, this is only because he fails to argue consistently from his own premises, leaving many of his conclu-swm m a confused state of semi-darkness. But this of course is only a pseudo-solution and no thinker of Hegel's stature could possibly rest content With it in the long run. However, we have been able to observe on a number of occasions that his confusion and obscurity are not essentially intellectual or methodological. On the contrary, we have seen again and again that they spring from the utopian illuswns he brought to the consideration of the present. The truth of the Marxist belief that a correct understanding of later historical developments provides a key to earlier ones, and that the present must be comprehended if the past is to be rightly understood, proves its worth m the case of Hegel himself. The decisive cnsis in his thought——and we shall describe it m detail in the next chapter——focused on his change of attitude towards the present, towards the reality of capitalism.
