It is evident that in Hegel's eyes the victory of feudal principles are sufficient to explain why Germany has ceased to be a state. And he goes on to show that these public laws founded on private rights have an internal tendency to make themselves autonomous, to emancipate themselves from the state and the nation as a whole and that this leads to a chaos of conflicting nghts and claims. Of course, law now appears to Hegel, even more now than later, not as the product but as the supreme principle of society and the state. But within the framework of this idealist distortion of reality he provides a vivid satirical picture of the situation in Germany where a single system gives one man as much right to resolve matters of war and peace for the entire nation as it gives another to possess so and so many fields or vineyards.^  
  
These passages where he so sharply condemns German conditions give a much clearer illustration of the more historical attitude towards positivity, obsolescence and the need for reform than we had seen m the Wiirttemberg article. He gives an extremely vivid picture of the once progressive forces that had been effective in the past and had indeed built up the imposing edifice of German Empire, and he also gives eloquent expression to the sense oftradition and loyalty that Germans feel for their past. But, on the other hand, he shows quite uncompromisingly that this entire historical structure is utterly divorced from the problems of the present and that, as he had formulated it in the Wiirttemberg pamphlet, the spirit had flown from it.  
  
'The building of the German constitution is the work of past centuries; it is not upheld by the life of the present; the entire fate of more than one century is imprinted in its forms and the justice and violence, courage and cowardice, the honour, the blood, the misery and the well-being of times long since dead and generations long since mouldering, still live on in it. The life and the forces whose development and activity are the pride of the generation now living have no share in it, no interest in it and derive no nourishment from it. This building with its pillars and archaic ornaments stands isolated from the spirit of the age. '2j  
  
Hegel does not use the word positivity here but this analysis undoubtedly contains an historical elaboration ofpositivity.  
  
Of particular significance for the development of his philosophy of history is the section where he deals with the 'saga of German freedom'. For the first time he presents an account of a primitive, stateless society, the kind of society that he later called the 'heroic age'. Later on, of course, it was the development of antiquity before the founding of the state that was so crucial for his thought, but there is also evidence to suggest (e.g. in the Aesthetics) that he thought of the end of the Middle Ages as such a period, as the Vico-like recurrence of such a period. The present discussion is very characteristic of his developing dialectical sense of history. For his position here is just as far from a glorification of primitive societies, and from any desire to return to them, as it is from any vulgar materialist contempt for them, from any temptation to look down on them condescendingly from the 'height of the latest achievements' of civilization. He gives an interesting picture of the so-called age of German freedom, ofa society  
  
'in which ethical customs rather than laws transform a mass into a people and where equal interest rather than a universal command constitutes the state.'  
  
And he concludes his discussion with the following general remarks: 
Just as it is cowardly and effete to describe the men of that society as loathsome, wretched and stupid, and to imagme ourselves to be infi-  
  
mtely more human, happy and clever, so too it is childish and silly to yearn for such a society——as if it alone were natural——or to fail to recogmze that a society ruled by law is necessary——and that it alone is  
  
free. '2 A few years later, in the theses of his dissertation m Jena, Hegel expresses the same idea in a much more pithy, paradoxical way. Talkmg about Hobbes, and to some extent polemicizing against him, he wntcs:  
  
'The state of nature is not unjust, and that is why man must emerge from it. '23  
  
The other fragment deals with these questions in a more general philosophical manner. Rosenkranz who first published it goes so far as to call it a synthesis of Hegel's thoughts about the world crisis.24  
  
Its starting-point and general mood arc already familiar to us from Part II, Chapter i. Following the descnption of the individual who finds himself in a state of crisis Hegel goes on to discuss the world-situation which he summarizes as follows:  
  
'All the manifestations ofthe age show that the old life no longer provides satisfaction; in that life man was limited to the ordered control ofhis possessions, the contemplative enjoyment ofhis utterly subordinate little world, and then, to reconcile him to these limitations, selfdestruction and elevation into heaven.'  
  
The age has put an end to this philistme, religious complacency. Both impovenshment and luxury have abolished the old state of affans. On the one hand, we see the pursmt of wealth, 'the bad conscience to turn one's property, things, into an absolute', and on the other hand, 'the spint of a better life ... has entered the age'. Hegel refers explicitly here to the French Revolution (and he may also have Napoleon in mind) and he also points to the great achievements of German literature and philosophy.  
  
'Its onward impetus is fed by the deeds of individuals ofgreat character, by the movements of entire peoples and by the depiction ofnature and fate in the works ofthe poets; while metaphysics sets limits to the restrictions of existence and gives them their necessity in the context ofthe whole.'25  
  
Hegel's notion of positivity is enriched here by a new element. The idea first became historicized——as we saw in the pamphlet on Wiirttemberg——when he argued that institutions that had once corresponded to the customs of the people in the course of time became divorced from their life and turned into positive mstituuons. Now he suggests that a new spirit may begin to stir amidst the old, inflexible, positive life, and the livmg antagonism and contrast between the old and the new makes things that have been historically superseded into 'positive' phenomena.  
  
How does Hegel imagine that change can be introduced into the crumbling Empire? He gives a brief, very general, philosophical statement, which for that very reason is more radical and politically concrete than elsewhere.  
  
'Life which is full of limitations is a power which can only be overcome by something better if it too becomes a power. ... Only as a particular against a particular can nature function in its actual life as an attack or refutation of the worse form oflife. . . . '25  
  
Hegel's realistic grasp of social conflict is undeniable here when he sees it as the struggle of one power against another (one particular against another). He is in no danger of embracing liberal illusions about 'the irresistible power of ideas' before which the fortresses of absolutism will crumble like the walls ofJericho at the soundofJoshua's trumpets. At the same time, he views the struggle against absolutism and the vestiges of feudalism in the same way as the ideological protagonists of the revolutionary bourgeoisie. Hence when he comes to concretize his attack on this calcified society he writes:  
  
'This society does not base its rule on the power of particular against particular, but on its universality. The truth, the right that it claims for itself must be taken from it and given to those elements of the life that is required. . . . The positive aspects of the existing order, which is a negation of nature, should be left in possession of their truth: that right must exist. 'TI  
  
When these very abstract and somewhat obscure statements are translated onto a philosophical plane they are seen to maintain the general polemic ofthe bourgeois revolutionary class against the old feudal order. They question the retensions ofthe ruling classes, offeudalism, to be the representatives an J leaders of society as a whole, and dismiss these claims as the arrogance ofa small minority, ofparticular interest groups. On the other hand, Hegel does not see the demands of the 'third estate' as the demands of one class vis-a-vis other classes; what he sees is the hitherto suppressed rights of the universal interest, the interests of society as a whole. Thus in the shift to the plane of the universal and the particular, the unmasking of the pretensions of a particular (feudal, absolutist) class to umversality, and the converse elevation of the particular demands of the bourgeois class into a universality sanctioned by nature and history, Hegel is simply providing an abstract philosophical statement of the ideas which, without any philosophical ambitions, formed the essential stock-in-trade of progressive writers before and during the French Revolution. And once again it is of great interest for his development as a thinker that the very first appearance of the dialectic of the umversal and particular should occur not in an abstract philosophical context but in an effort to clarify his thoughts about the real historical dialectics of the destruction offeudalism by the bourgeoisie both for himself and for others.  
  
Hegel's further discussions show even more clearly how the philosophical approach sprang from political and histoncal problems. Immediately after the last passage quoted he goes on to say:  
  
'In the German Empire a universal source of rights has ceased to exist, since it has isolated itself and turned itself into a particular. Hence universality exists now only as an idea and not as reality.'2l  
  
This latter idea provides further confirmation that Hegel's enemy here was the still surviving feudal, absolutist order. From the point of view of his philosophical development we must remind ourselves of those extracts from the Nohl fragments in which he attempted to find a new definition of positivity (see pp. 125—7 supra). We showed there that Hegel's new distinction between the positive and the non-positive was that while both were unions, syntheses, the positive was only an idea, a thought, while the non-positive was a bemg.
