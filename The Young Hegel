## PART II The Crisis in Hegel's views on Society and the Earliest Beginnings of his Dialectical Method (Frankfurt 1797—1800)

### Chapter 1 General description of the Frankfurt period
There was no path leading from the views Hegel had formed in Berne to the social reality of his situation in Germany. Any attempt to turn such views to practical account was rendered futile from the outset by the untimeliness, indeed the objective impossibility, of a bourgeois revolution in Germany. Yet Hegel had been passionately concerned with practice right from the start. He had always hoped to take an active part m the political life of his time. It is quite typical of him that he had no sooner completed "/ he Phenomenology of Mind than he eagerly accepted the post of editor offered to him in Bamberg. It is true that he later became disillusioned by his experiences in Bamberg but this was due chiefly to a censorship which severely restricted the scope ofthe newspaper.

There can be no doubt that a considerable section of the German bourgeois intelligentsia sympathized with the ideas of the French Revolution. In all probability the number of sympathizers has been underplayed by the tendentious descriptions of bourgeois historiography. However, it was never sufficiently large or influential either materially or morally to ensure the wide dissemination of the ideas of the French Revolution in the press or through literature and philosophy. This is clearly borne out by the tragic fate ofHegel's friend Holderlin.

The gulf between Hegel's Berne views and the state of society was widened still further by the course of the French Revolution itself. This had two causes: on the one hand, the internal logic of the class struggles in France itself and, on the other hand, the effects of the wars waged by the French Republic in response to the intervention of the absolutist feudal powers.

The great turning-point ofthe French Revolution, the events ofTher-midor (1794), came while Hegel was still in Berne. It appears not to have made any decisive immediate impression on him. We have seen how he welcomed the reprisals directed against the followers ofRobespierre, but this does no more than confirm the distance separating him from the radical, plebeian wing of the French Revolution. But we cannot detect any change in his republican and revolutionary views after Thermidor. At first glance this is a surprising fact, but it can be explained both by the course of the Revolution itself and by the young Hegel's own standpoint. The internal history of France under the Directory was a constant

balancing act by the bourgeois republicans who desired to preserve and consolidate their gains, gains essential for the bourgeoisie, and who were caught between royalist attempts to turn the clock back and efforts by the rump ofthe radical parties to advance the plebeian side ofthe Revolution. The leaders of the bourgeois republicans were repeatedly forced into a temporary alliance with one or other ofthese extremes and the resulting instability eventually expressed itself in a need for military dictatorship. Hence Napoleon Bonaparte's coup d'hat on 9 November 1 799.

Even more important for an understanding of the period is an analysis of the social implications of Thermidor itself. In contrast to the liberal historians and the Trotskyites, their counter-revolutionary parrots, Marx defines the social content of Thermidor with extraordinary clarity:

'After the fall of Robespierre the political Enlightenment ... which had been rhapsodic hitherto, began to transform itself into a prosaic reality. Under the government of the Directory, bourgeois society, freed by the Revolution from the trammels of feudalism and officially recognized in spite of the Terror's wish to sacrifice it to an ancient form of political life, broke out in powerful streams of life. The storm and stress of commercial enterprise, the craze for wealth, the frenzy of the new bourgeois life, whose first self-enjoyment is still audacious, heedless, frivolous and intoxicating; a real enlightenment of French landed property whose feudal forms had been smashed by the hammer of revolution and which had become the object of all-round cultivation thanks to the feverish energy of its many new owners; the first stirrings of an emancipated industry——these are some of the manifestations of the new-born bourgeois society. Bourgeois society is represented positively by the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie thus begins its reign.'1

Naturally enough, in a backward Germany the echo of this new phase in the history of the French bourgeoisie is even more distorted, indirect and ideological than the heroic events of the Revolution itself. There could be no question of an economic boom in Germany corresponding to developments in France. Very few German observers understood or were even able to understand the economic implications of post-Thermidorean France. But this only reinforced the ideological consequences. The very fact that the majority of bourgeois humanists in Germany misunderstood and rejected the plebeian asceticism ofthe extreme left in France necessarily gave rise to a feeling of sympathy for a lifeloving and life-affirming bourgeois regime that rejected both feudalism and reaction while also proceeding energetically against revolutionary 'extremes'. This sympathy which at a later stage became focused on the person of Napoleon contained elements of a humanist idealization and romanticization of post-Thermidorean developments.

Thus we witness the birth of a naive belief that It might be possible to realize the humanist ideal ofan all-round, fUlly developed, life-affirming mankind in the context of ex1stmg bourgems society. It goes without saymg that the Important spokesmen of bourgeois humanism were aware of the contradictions in this society and above all of the obstacles and impediments which capitalism places in the path of the individual seeking to develop his personality. Getting to grips with these problems constitutes one of the chief themes of German classical literature. In the course of our discussion ofHegel's views in this period we shall see again and again the many parallels between his thought and that of the outstanding representatives of classical humanism in Germany, the thought of Goethe and Schiller. Here too the imperialist neo-Hegelians, who have pounced on the intellectual and terminological confusion, obscurity and mysticism ofHegel's Frankfurt period in order to represent him as the forerunner or supporter of reactionary Romanticism, have turned the truth upside down.

At this stage of French history, then, the debates surrounding bourgeois society stand in the foreground. In line with the backwardness of Germany on the social, economic and political planes these debates take place m an almost pure ideological realm. There is no political analysis of bourgems society as there is in France, no scientific investigation of the underlying laws ofthe economy as m England. Instead we find a probing into the situation of man, of personality and its development within bourgeois society from a humanist standpoint. Ideological this analysis may be, but for all that it is undoubtedly a reflection of French developments after Thermidor and in the literary products of the period, above all in those ofGoethe, an extraordinary degree ofrealism is achieved.

In Hegel's early philosophy idealistic elements are incomparably more prominent and influential. But it must be emphasized——and here we anticipate a fundamental tendency in his development——that Hegel, alone among German thinkers of his day, was impelled by the logic of his analysis of bourgeois society to undertake a serious examination of the problems of economics. And this is reflected not just in the circumstance that he, alone among the leading German thinkers, made a thorough study of the classical English economists; his interest went beyond that and extended, as we shall see, to an examination of the concrete economic problems of England. Thus in the Frankfurt period we see an extraordinary widening of Hegel's intellectual horizons. In Berne his views on the philosophy of history had been founded on the world-historical fact of the French Revolution. From now on the economic development of England likewise becomes a basic component of his view of history and his understanding of society. But for all this it remams true that Hegel was still a German philosopher whose fundamental 
vmon was determined m every respect by the backwardness of Ger many. Indeed it was precisely this which became more marked during the Frankfurt penod, and this was a direct consequence of the French Revolution itself. After an absence ofthree years Hegel returned to Germany, spent a few months m his native land, Wiirttemberg, and went from there to live m Frankfurt, one ofthe commercial centres ofGermanv- He was in a good position, therefore, to inspect the effects of the French Revolution on life m Germany. In Wurttemberg these effects were quite powerful and——within the framework of Germany's general backwardness——they were the cause of a government cnsis which lasted for a number of years. Hence the problem of how the absolutist feudal struc ture ofGermany would have to be modified because ofthe French Revolution appeared to Hegel not just as a general histoncal issue but m concrete political terms.

But by this time the impact of the French Revolution in Germany was no longer confmed to this ideological aspect, to the growing awareness that the feudal governments had become untenable. This was the very penod m which the campaigns which had started as wars to defend the French Republic now went over to an almost continuous offensive. In the 6rst mstance this meant that Germany and Italy had to provide the battlefields, instead ofFrance itself. More importantly, however, developments after Thermidor meant that the mixture of a defensive war and an international propaganda war which had prevailed in the first years of the Revolution increasingly gave way to what was predominantly a war ofconquest. Elements ofthe propaganda war did survive throughout the entire period, even under the Empire. Every French government found itself compelled to sweep away the vestiges of feudalism in the conquered territories as far as possible, and to bring such areas into line with the political and economic state ofFrance. But increasingly this tendency became subordinated to the self-aggrandizement ofthe bourgems republic, and later ofthe Empire.

Thus the wars with France intervened directly and profoundly in the lives of Germans. As we shall see later m detail this intervention was full of contradictions. On the one hand, the best and most progressive ideologists of Germany placed their hopes for the rejuvenation of Germany m the influence ofthe French Revolution, and this sometimes went as far as welcoming armed intervention. We are not thinking here only ofthe settmg up ofa republic in Mainz and the connection between this and the temporarily victorious campaign ofCustme; for even later, at the time of the Confederation ofthe Rhine, this mood had not vanished completely. On the other hand, the French invasions increased the fragmentation of the German nation. National unity, the emergence ofa unified nationstate seemed to become even more remote, the possibility of achieving it ever more dubious.

In the course of our detailed discussion of Hegel's Frankfurt period we shall see how far he was from a political and philosophical resolution of the contradictions ansmg from this situation. But we shall also be able to see how his greater proximity to the concrete problems ofbourgeois so-nety and ofthe political and social fate of Germany led him to place the phenomenon of contradictonness in the forefront of his own thought: we see how he comes to experience contradiction as the foundation and the driving force of life. We emphasize the word 'experience', since Hegel's development, unlike that of Schelling, docs not mvolvc a progress from one philosophical system to the next. We must recall what we said about Hegel's Berne period, above all the fact that he showed a remarkable lack of interest in philosophical problems, especially those of epistemology and log1c. His aim was to probe certain social and historical interconnections and he had recourse to philosophy only as a basis for the generalizations indispensable to that task. Initially and in general terms this remains his procedure in Frankfurt. But we shall see that over and above the increasing concretization of the soc1al and political problems he tackles, there is also a growing tendency consciously to concern himself directly w1th philosophical questwns so that soc1al and political issues become increasingly translated into philosophical problems. And interestmgly enough, this happens all the more abruptly and directly when the philosophical core of the problem under discussion hinges on the nature ofcontradiction.

The difficulty facing the interpreter of Hegel's notes and fragmentary writings can be located in the extraordinarily abrupt, unmediated, unprepared transition to the philosophical plane. In glaring contrast to both his earlier and his later writings Hegel s thought in Frankfurt proceeds almost always from his own personal experiences and his style bears the marks of both the passion and the confuswn, the unresolved nature of personal experience. Moreover, his first attempts to articulate philosophically the contradictions he has experienced himself rarely achieves genuine clarity and definition either in form or content. Hegel's earliest philosophical pronouncements often peter out in mystical abstractions. An additional factor is that to start with he evidently feels hardly any need to grasp particular ideas in a systematic fashion. In the first instance he is concerned to solve specific concrete historical and also political problems. At the same time philosophical views tend to grow out ofhis analyses ofparticular phenomena and the connections between them become increasingly intimate. Finally, at the end of the Frankfurt period he makes the first attempt in his life to gather his philosophical views together into a single system.

Thus the first appearance ofthe dialectical method m Hegel is highly confused. His contradictory experiences of the particular manifestations oflife are welded together in a highly mystified totality which Hegel repeatedly designates with the word 'life'. As yet he has made no systematic reckoning with logic or with the epistemology of metaphysical thought. Thus the opposition between dialectics and metaphysics appears to him as a contrast between thought, idea, concept, etc., on the one hand, and 'life' on the other. This contrast already gives an mdi-cation of the profundity of the dialectics of Hegel's maturity, with their pamonate grasp ofthe contradictions contained in the concrete phenomena of existence. As Lenin has convincingly shown, this often bnngs him within reach of true, materialist dialectics. In the Frankfurt period, however, his conception of'life' is not only confused in itself, but Its content is essentially mystical. For at this stage the opposition between ideas and life drives him to regard religion as the highest consummation of 'life' and thus as the apex ofhis philosophical system.

This represents an extraordinary change when we compare it to his Berne period. As we shall show in detail this change reflects the fact that Hegel's prime concern from now on is with the place of the individual, of man in civil society. In Berne Hegel had, to a certain extent, still looked at the society ofhis day from outside. That is to say, he had regarded the entire course ofhistory from the fall ofthe Roman republic to the present as a unified process of decline, as a stage embracing the whole ofhistory which was merely provisional, even though it might last for centuries, and which would be succeeded in the end by a revival of the republics of classical antiquity. Consistently with this he had eyes only for the negative sides of this process. We might say m short that he regarded the enure history ofcivil society as a single process ofdecay.

The change that now takes place in his thought can be indicated by the fact that he begins to see in civil society a fundamental, incontrovertible fact with whose existence and nature he has to come to terms both intellectually and practically. This process begins in a highly subjective manner, i.e. Hegel is not yet able to inquire mto the objective nature of civil society, as he will do later atJena. His present problem is to discover how the individual has to proceed m order to come to terms with civil society, how the moral and humanist postulates of personal development come into conflict with the laws and the nature of civil society and how these contradictions can be ironed out and the opposites reconciled.

This development entails a fundamental change in Hegel's attitude to the present. To indicate his attitude we have employed what was to become the celebrated and notorious category of'reconciliation'. This is no accident, for this category which, as we recall, he had attacked so violently in Berne (see p. 69-71), re-emerges in this period as a crucial problem. It is not that he fails to explore contradictions in the relations between the individual and society, or, more accurately, that in the course of his analysis of concrete problems, ever new contradictions fail to come to light. It is that the goal of his thought is to annul contradictions, to reconcile them whenever they appear. (The term 'annul' [aufhe-ben], so vital for his later thought, likewise makes its first appearance m Frankfurt and gradually becomes a dominant category in his wntings.)

This new form ofHegelian subjectivism must be sharply distinguished from the subjective idealism ofhis Berne period. The latter has been fully discussed m Part I and we need here only remmd the reader of our conclusion that at that stage the subject of the socio-historical process was always a collective one. The separation of the individual from the immediately social nature oflife in the city-state of antiquity, the emergence of 'private human beings' appeared to Hegel as uie clearest possible symptom ofdecadence. HegePs Frankfurt subjectivism, however, is subjectivism m a literal sense. He really does begin immediately with the mdividual, with his cxpencnces and fate and goes on to study the specific forms of society and their mfl.ucnce on this mdividual fate, their interaction with each other.

Only slowly and gradually does the study of the individual's objective environment, of civil society, gam the upper hand. From the standpomt ofthe mdividual destmy of the mdividual human bemg, of the 'private human being' he had formerly so despised, Hegel now attempts to trace the general laws of society and to press forward to an objective understanding of them. The old problem of 'positivity' makes its reappearance as a central problem, but is given a much more complex, contradictory and historical treatment than in Berne. And this very issue now leads Hegel to a far more penetratmg study of the dominant forces active in Civil society: it leads to .a study of economic problems. His •efforts to discover a philosophical reconciliation between the humanist ideals of the development of personality and the objective, immutable facts of society leads him to an increasingly profound understanding, firstly ofthe problems ofprivate property and later oflabour as the fundamental mode ofinteraction between individual and societv.

Hegel's changed attitude to the present is associated with an equally radical change m his view of Christianity. After what we have said up to now this can scarcely come as a surpnse. It is a commonplace that the major turmng-points in every idealist view of history are closely bound up with religious changes. Even Feuerbach fails to diverge from this pattern. In the case of Hegel the negative evaluation placed on civil society, the society of 'pnvate human beings' had been mtimately connected with his views of Christianity. Notwithstanding his efforts to discover the social causes for the decline of the city-states of antiquity he was left essentially with Christianity as the driving force of the modern world. Given such a conception of history it is hardly surprising that any modification of his view of the present should at once carry over to his judgment of Chnstianity. Since his early idealist position remained intact in Frankfurt, and even took a definite turn towards religwus mysticism, Christiamty was the obvious source for the ideological and moral foundations for the modern world.

That such a position is idealistic is too obvious to reqmre any discussion. At the same time we must point out that it is not accidental or without roots. Hence its persistence and even indestructibility. These roots whose effects make their appearance in such distorted and mystical forms in the various idealist systems ofhistory are in fact the objective histoncal bond connecting Christianity to the entire history ofthe modern world. In a number of profound and detailed studies Marx and Engels have explained why Christianity alone, rather than any of the other sects which proliferated at the time ofthe collapse ofthe Roman Empire, was able to expand into a world religion. They have shown how Christianity was able to adapt itself to prevailing needs in the different phases of the economic development of Europe and how the various stages ofthe class struggle in Europe were accompanied by novel forms of Christiamty (medieval sects, Lutheranism, Calvinism etc). And they have shown that even modern bourgeois society must contmue to give birth to a superstructure ofChnstianity modified in certam definite ways. In his polemic against Bruno Bauer, the Young Hegelian idealist, Marx states:

'In fact the perfect Christian state is not the so-called Christian state which proclaims Christianity as its foundation, as state-religion, and which consequently tends to exclude other religions. It is rather the atheistic state, the democratic state, the state which relegates the Christian religion to a place on a par with the other elements of civil society ...This state is able to abstract from religion because the human basis of religion is incorporated in itself in a secular form . . . The foundation of this state is not Christianity, but the human ground of Christianity. Religion remains the ideal, unworldly consciousness of its members because it is the ideal form of that stage of human development which is realized in the democratic state. '2

In idealist theories of history, not excluding that of the young Hegel, these real historical connections appear upside-down and in a distorted form. Christianity, the necessary product of social developments m the Middle Ages and in modern times, appears as the primary driving force of history. In these general terms there is no decisive shift m Hegel's philosophy m Frankfurt from his earlier position in Berne. Whether he rejects Christianity in Berne or seeks a reconciliation with it in Frankfurt amounts to much the same thing, for in both cases religion retains the dommant position m his typically idealistic view of history. Of course, smce Hegel starts from the problems of life facing the mdividual and since he is in search ofa reconciliation with the present, this gives rise to a much more intimate relationship with Christianity than he had enjoyed hitherto. In this sense his attitude in Frankfurt reverses that ofBerne.

The choice of the problems of the individual as a startmg-pomt is something that we only find in Hegel during the transitional period of crisis in Frankfurt. Both in his earliest works and in his matunty the individual mterests him only as a member of society. The incisive cnticism directed later at the moral positions of Kant and Fichte, Schleiermacher and the Romantics generally focuses on their failure, expressed in a variety of ways, to see that apparently pure individual actions have a social component and that even individual ethical categories arc socially conditioned and determined. Thus Hegel's own concern with the individual, his own use ofthe individual's nccds and aspirations as a base point for his thought, is no more than an episode in his career, even though it is an episode fraught with consequences which persist in later years. Wc shall see agam and again that the first seeds of the method of The Phenomenology of Mind can be traced back to Hegel's approach in Frankfurt: to the journey from individual consciousness to the objective problems of society, to his attempts to discover specific dialectical stages of thought and feeling, i.e. to demonstrate that a higher stage results from elimm-atmg the contradictions oflower stages.

The Frankfurt writmgs only disclose this message, however, when onc looks at them with the later works in mind. Considered on their own, or after the Berne writmgs, their opacity and confuswn is astonishing. Never again will such unclarifled concepts buried in a haze of unspoken meanings play such a prommcnt role in Hegel's thought as in Frankfurt. The experience that contradictonness is the foundation of life breaks through with increasing intensity but at this stage the contradictwns seem to be tragically incapable of resolution. It is no accident that for a time categories such as fate become the fulcra ofliis efforts to comprehend the world in philosophical concepts and that only in this period does a mysucal conception of the religious life form the climax of his thought. For his life and thought are gomg through a period of crim whose social and histoncal origins we have bnefly indicated in our introductory remarks: the crisis in his republican, revolutionary views, a crisis which found a provisional solution inJena when he came to accept the existing social order in its specifically Napoleonic form. In his Frankfurt penod Hegel gropes towards something new and slowly but steadily dismantles the old; there is uncertainty, a quest——a genuine crisis.

Hegel was fully conscious of this himself, and both at the time and m his later writings he makes reference to his experience of cnsis. It is typical ofhis later wntings that Hegel speaks with the utmost frankness ofthe unhappy state ofhypochondria, self-laceration and dismtegration which he experienced. In the description in the Encyclopaedia of the different ages of man Hegel gives an account of adolescence and of the approach to manhood which draws heavily on the Frankfurt penod. He says that the ideals of youth have a more or less subjective quality.

'The subjectivity ofthe substantive content of such an ideal implies not only an opposition to the world as it is, but also the urge to do away with this opposition by realizing the ideal.'

The transition ofthe youth from his ideal life into civil society involves a painful process ofadaptation punctuated by crises.

'There is no easy escape . . . from this hypochondria. The later one is infected by it, the more seriom its symptoms are. [Hegel's Frankfurt period fell between the ages of 27 and 30.] . . . In this morbid mood a man is reluctant to surrender his subjectivity, he is unable to overcome his antipathy for reality and so finds himself in a state of relative impotence which can easily turn into true impotence. Therefore, if a man wishes to survive, he must acknowledge that the world is independent and essentially complete . . .'3

Even more revealing, because it is more personal, is this description of the Frankfurt penod in a letter of I 8 1 o:

'I know from my own experience this state ofthe mind or rather the moral reason once it has ventured with its interest and its fears into the chaotic realm of the phenomenal world ... inwardly certain of its goal but as yet unclear and unspecific about it as a whole. I suffered from this hypochondria for a number of years to the point of total exhaustion; no doubt every man expenences such a turning-point in his life, the nocturnal point where his whole being contracts and he must force himselfthrough the narrows until he becomes secure and certain ofhimself, secure in ordinary daily life, and ifhe has already made himself incapable of being fulfilled by that, then secure in a more mward, more noble existence.，4

The Frankfurt documents are even more explicit. The concrete human and social factors that triggered off the cnsis arc revealed much more clearly than in the more general remmiscences oflater years. Thus a fragment of Hegel's pamphlet on J he German Constitution begins with a descripuon ofthe spiritual climate ofthe modern world.

'They [human beings] cannot live alone and man is always alone. . . . The state of a man whom the age has dnvcn into an inner world will either be no more than a livmg death, ifhe confines himself to that world. or, ifnature urges him back into life, there will be a sustained endeavour to annul the negative elements of the world a> it is so as to enable him to discover and enjoy himself in it and to survive.'5

Hegel's most mtimate confessions can be found in some letters that he

wrote at the beginnmg ofhis stay in Frankfurt to Nanette Endel, a friend ofhis sister whom he had got to know m Stuttgart after leaving Berne. In a letter of 9 February 1797 he wnte;:

'...and since I find that it would be an utterly ungrateful task to set an example to people here and it is certam that St Anthony of Padua had greater success preaching to the fish than I would achieve by such a life here, I have resolved after lengthy meditation to make no attempt to improve these people but instead to follow the crowd ...'

Other documents reveal that Hegel was on much better terms with the Frankfurt family where he was employed as a tutor than he had enjoyed with his pupils and their familyin Berne. We have seen his brusque rejection of the Berne patnciate m his letter to Schellmg. The present letter shows how profoundly Hegel had changed his external attitudes towards the people around him. It might be thought that the above quotation points to the purely tactical nature or even the outright hypocrisy ofHegel's relations with the people around him. However, such motives are qmte alien to his character. A passage from another letter dated 2 July 1797 in which he talks to Nanette Endel of the change in his view of nature shows quite clearly that we are dealing with a much more fundamental change in his outlook as a whole:

'...and just as in Berne I fled into the arms of nature to reconcile myself with myself and with mankind so here I often seek refuge in the bosom of this ever-loyal mother so as to fall out with the people with whom I live here peaceably, and so that under her aegis I may become immune from their mfluence and frustrate anv alliance with

1        9C.                                                                               '

them*

These letters, particularly the latter, reveal the change m Hegel's attitude to the society ofhis day. At the same time we notice that this change contams an mternal contradiction, or rather, an entire complex of contradictions from the very outset. Hegel himself only gradually became conscious of the character and the objective basis of these contradictions. Hence the tortured, hypochondnacal crisis-ridden mood of the Frankfurt period despite the fact that his personal circumstances were much more congenial than in Berne. I am not thinking here just of his external circumstances: intellectually he was far less isolated in Frankfurt than he had been in Berne; in the initial period he was in close COntact with his friend Holderlin and through him he made the acquaintance ofother far from msigni6cant representatives of the younger literary and philosophical generation in Germany, such as Sinclair.7

On the other hand, the fact that these contradictions are essentially experienced and bound up with his personal fate rather than systemauc and conceptual in nature leads to the preoccupation with philosophical problems already mentioned in which he advances from an individual experience to a conceptual generalization but in such a manner that the final conclusions reveal the entire process that led to them including the original experience that gave rise to them. In the fragment from The German Constitution already referred to we have seen an illustration of this approach. The reason for it is that Hegel is still on the road to becom-mg a dialectical philosopher. He docs not yet regard the personal experience that triggers his thought as he will do later in Jena, as something whose objective ongins and laws need to be examined. He sees it as an mtegral part of the problem under discussion. This is perfectly understandable since the problem he is tackling is his personal debate with society, his attempt to discover a place for himself within society.

Obviously, this is not just a personal problem. If it had merely belonged to Hegel's own biography it would not hold the great interest for us which it m fact possesses. But the contradicnon with which Hegel is struggling m Frankfurt is objecnvely the same as that which engaged all the important thinkers and writers of the age in Germany. The solution .to it constitutes the premise on which the classical literature and philosophy of the penod is based and smce this literature and philosophy have achieved mternational recogmtion it follows that the social contradiction at their roots must be more than a local German affair, even though its specific manifestatwns were determmed by the actual conditions in Germanv at the time.

'

What is at issue is the attitude of the great German humanists towards the bourgeois society that had triumphed m the French Revolution and m the Industnal Revolution m England, but which simultaneously had begun to reveal its horrifying, anti-cultural and prosaic aspects with a clarity very different from the period of heroic illusions before and durmg the French Revolution. The major bourgems humanists m Germany now found themselves confronted by the complex and contradictory necessity of having both to recognize this bourgeois society, of accepting it as the only possible necessary and progressive reality, and at the same time to expose and denounce its contradictions critically and freely, rather than to capitulate and apologize for the inhumanity they entailed. In Goethe's Wilhelm Meister and Faust, in Schiller's Wallenstein and his aesthetic wntmgs and in Hegel's The PhenometwloRy of Mind as well as his later works we see how German literary and philosophical classicism came to gnps with these contradictions and proposed various soluuons; the way in which they did so is proof of their world-histoncal stature——and at the same time it shows the limitations imposed on them by the honzons of the bourgeoisie in general and the backwardness of Germany m particular.

When Hegel, m the letter we have quoted, seeks refuge m nature so a> to avoid bemg assimilated into his socal environment we may regard this as a primitive, immediate expression ofjust this contradiction. On theone hand, his aim is thoroughly to understand and to fUnction within the civil society of his day; on the other hand, he recoils from its inhuman, lifeless and life-denying aspects, refusing to see them as vital and life-givmg. The contradiction that emerges in his earliest experiences in Frankfurt is therefore both a passionately grasped and experienced contradiction m his personal life and also, and inseparably from this, an important objective contradiction ofhis age.

The Frankfort crisis, then, in Hegel's life and thought expresses itself in the difficulties ofraising this contradiction to the plane of philosophical objectivity. Hegel's philosophical genius, his intellectual superiority over his contemporaries enable him to go further than the mere statement of a contradiction in his own personal experience; they enable him to recognize not just the contradictoriness of bourgeois society (within the bounds imposed on him by the general limitations of the bourgeois mind and the barriers ofphilosophical idealism), but beyond that to sec m such contradictoriness the dialectical nature of all life, of all being and thought. The Frankfurt cnsis ends with Hegel's earliest formulations of the dialectical method, albeit m a highly mystical version. It ends also ——and not by chance——in a dialectical 'reconciliation' with the society of his age which fully acknowledges the underlying contradictions of that society. In a brief poem written either at the end of his stay in Frankfurt or shortly after he moved to Jena Hegel gives a very clear statement of the mood that enabled him to overcome the crisis:

'Kuhn mag der Gotter Sohn der Vollendung Kampfsich vertrauen, Brich den Frieden mit dir, brich mit dem W erke der Welt!

Strebe, versuche du mehr als das Heutund das Gestern, so wirst du Besseres nicht, als die Zeit, aber aufs Beste sic sein.'

[Boldly the son ofthe gods may join the battle for perfection

Break your peace with yourself, break with the works ofthe world!

Stnve for, aspire to more than today and yesterday

Then you will be not better than the age, but the age at its best.]8

### CHAPTER 2 Old and new in the first years in Frankfurt
One ofthe outstanding features ofHegel's character as a philosopher was his slow and gradual development. In the preceding chapter we emphasized the radical change in his outlook in order to give the reader a clear idea of the intellectual mood of his years in Frankfurt. In reality, however, this process was a gradual one, though he sometimes advanced m fits and starts. Many attitudes of his Berne period remained unaltered for a long time or were subject to only minor.changes. Sometimes we find him modifying old ideas, old historical constructs without realizing clearly how far he has departed from the origmal pattern. An mstance can be seen in his last work in Frankfurt: he wrote a new introduction to his principal essay in Berne, The Positivity of the Christian Religion, even though, as we shall see, his conception of positivity had undergone a complete transformation in the meantime. And what happened here is typical ofhis general development.

In particular, we must bear in mind that throughout this penod Hegel kept faith with his republican convictions. Indeed, it can be asserted that Hegel did not 'reconcile' himself to a monarchy in the German style until confronted with the stability of the Restoration after the defeat of Napoleon. Until then we find a highly complex series of transitiom which are not entirely reconstructible because ofthe loss ofthe most vital manuscripts. In general, however, we may say that his development proceeded along the lines of political developments in France, though wah certain inevitable delays. The only reservation to be made here is that Hegel increasingly takes the theoretical and practical implications of the situation in Germany into account. This means that his political analyses gain in concreteness and immediacy, but also that the utopian character of his objectives and aspirations——given the backwardness of German conditions—— onstantly undermines his arguments or makes them disappear in a fog ofspeculation.

When Hegel left Berne for Frankfurt he took his republican convictions with him. His mood at that time is well conveyed by the poem Eleusis which he wrote to Holderlin from Berne and which expresses his feelings about the prospect of their reumon. A few lines will suffice to give the reader the flavour ofHegel's mood:

'...der Gewissheit Wonne

des alten Bundes Treue fester, reifer noch zu finden,

des Bundes, den kein Eid besiegelte,

der freien Wahrheit nur zu leben, Frieden mit der Satzung, die Meinung und Empfindung regelt, nie, nie einzugehen'.

[The certain bliss

of finding the old pact firmer, riper, the pact sealed by no oath, to live for the free truth alone

and never, never to make peace with laws

that prescribe thought and feeling.]1

The very beginning ofHegel's stay in Frankfurt is marked by the appearance ofhis first printed work, one which on the whole still reflects his Berne attitudes. It was an annotated translation ofa pamphlet byJ. J. Cart, a Swiss lawyer, which wac concerned with a defence of the rights of the Vaudois against the Berne oligarchy. The canton of Vaud had been oppressed by Berne for centuries. An attempted uprising in the wake of the French Revolution had failed and had only brought sterner reactionary measures from the Berne oligarchy. The liberation of the canton came only in the course of the revolutionary wars at around the time when Hegel was engaged on his translation and commentary. In his preface Hegel makes explicit reference to this turn of events and evidently published his pamphlet with the intention of providing the arrogant forces of reaction in Germany with an image of the instability of their power. At the conclusion ofhis preface he writes:

'From a comparison of the contents of these letters with the latest events in the Vaud, from a contrast between the appearance of peace enforced in 1792 and the pride of the government in its victory with its real weakness in this land and its sudden downfall there, a whole host of practical lessons might be learnt; however, the events speak plainly enough for themselves: all that remains to be done is to appreciate them fully. Their cry echoes above the whole world: Discite justitiarn rnoniti. But fate will smite hard those who are deaf. '2

These remarks show that Hegel's outlook had not changed since he left Berne. But Falkenheim, who discovered the pamphlet, has already attempted to exploit certain elements in it to disprove Hegel's revolutionary tendencies. He bases his argument on the fact that in the preface Hegel defends the 'ancient rights' of the Vaudois against the Bemese oligarchy. He declares that no revolutionary would do that. A further symptom of the non-revolutionary character of the pamphlet follows from this, namely the historical method ofpresentation. This argument is based on the old reactionary prejudice widespread among German professors to the effect that historicism is an invention of the reaction, that it began with Burke and the French philosophers ofthe Restoration in contrast to the preceding age which was essentially anti-historical. There is no point in pursuing this theory, especially as the reader can see from Part I the extent of Hegel's historical orientation in his early revolutionary and republican views and the Cart translation is no exception to this.

No less untrue is the deduction made from Hegel's defence of'ancient nghts'. The very great importance of such struggles for 'ancient rights' can be seen in the events leading up to the French Revolution itself. Of course, the entire development is highly ambivalent. In part It mvolves the defence of feudal privileges against the levelling down by absolutism 111 the name of economic and soctal progress; 111 part it concerns the struggle to protect the nghts of working people jeopardized by the process ofprimitive accumulation as initiated by feudalism and capitalism 111 league together. A further aspect of such traditional privileges is that they can provide a certain protection against the arbitrary encroachments of the absolute monarchy. The French parliaments, for example, were essentially reactionary institutions who sternly resisted every attempt to reform taxation or abolish even the most miqmtous feudal privileges and in consequence they attracted the fiercest criticism from all the important members of the French Enlightenment. But at the same time, since they were the only orgamzed foci of resistance to the encroachments of absolutism they enjoyed tremendous popularity in the years leading up to the French Revolution.3 Marx and Engels even go so far in their polemic against Guizot as to single out this 'conservative' element of France in the penod leading up to the Revolution as Its most characteristic feature.4

It is evident that in countnes more backward than Switzerland or Germany the defence of 'ancient rights' plays an even greater if also more ambivalent role. But however that may be there can be do doubt that when Hegel takes up the defence of the Vaudois agamst the Bernese oligarchy he is not doing so from an anti-revolutionary position. No doubt his defence of' ancient rights' is not undertaken from an explicit and consistent democratic point ofview. He does not make that distinction here any more than Schiller does a few years later when he dramatizes the defence of the 'ancient rights' of the people in Wilhelm Tell. It is only when we come to the young Marx's important articles in the Rheinische Zeitung that we f1nd a consistent revolutionary and democratic line which distmguishes between the 'ancient nghts' of the working people and the pnvileges of exploiters.

Although we have seen that this pamphlet heralds no change m Hegel's position this does not detract from the importance ofhis notes for an understanding of his development. We should just mention briefly here that his hatred ofthe aristocratic regime in Berne is just as fierce as in the letter to Schelling previously quoted, but is much more firmly founded on factual evidence. The diligence with which Hegel has assembled information about the Bernese economy, system oftaxation etc. is quite remarkable. We obtain here a glimpse into his workshop and can gain some idea of the prodigious effort that later went into acquiring his encyclopaedic knowledge ofalmost every field. These economic studies also have an additional, negative significance: it is notable that they are still no more than purely empirical collections of factual information together with political commentaries. The idea of generalizations about economic problems clearly has not yet occurred to Hegel.5 There is also a further feature of biographical importance in that we find Hegel occupying himself for the first time with conditions in England. At this stage he does so purely in the context ofthe politics ofthe French Revolution. He comments on a statement by Cart who attacks the nouon that a low rate of taxation provides an index ofthe happmess of a people. Cart points out that in England, which he greatly admired, taxation was heavy but the people freely admimstered their own affairs. Hegel concurred in this view and even reinforced it by pointing to the significance ofthe tax on tea as a cause in the outbreak ofthe American War of Independence. The point here was that in his view the tax was unimportant in itself but that the struggle for independence was sufficient to launch the revolution. He diverges from Cart only in his estimate of English liberty. He mentions the acts of repression in England following the French Revolution, the weakness of Parliament vis-a-vis the government, the suspension of constitutional safeguards and the abrogauon of personal freedoms and the rights ofcitizens. He says in conclusion:

'Thanks to these measures the prestige of the English nation has declined even among many ofher greatest admirers. '6

We may regard this work then as a late echo ofHegel's Berne period.

All the more striking is the change in his thought, his style and his approach to philosophical problems in the fragments dating from the same period or a little later which have been published by NohU In all of them signs of the Frankfurt crisis are clearly visible. We have already suggested that Hegel's terminology was never so fluid and confused as during this period. He takes up concepts, experiments with them, modifies them and drops them again. Just because his thought begins to concern itself with the contradictoriness oflife his notes seem at first glance to contain nothing but a confused tangle of contradictions. The source of the confusion lies in the predominantly personal nature of his approach to reality. It is easy to understand how the opacity of the Frankfurt fragments has proved to be a regular hunting-ground for reactionary interpretations and for attempts to assimilate Hegel to the reactionary mysticism of the Romantics. Dilthey 's celebrated book has providedthe model for theentire literature on Hegel in the Ageoflmperi-alism. These critics managed to remove almost all reference to contemporary events and social problems even from the Berne writings so 1t will not come as a surprise to see the FrankfUrt fragments described as 'mystical pantheism' (Dilthey). This makes it all the more pressing to 1solate the——admittedly meagre and confUsed——core of rationality they do possess, the1r bearing on reality and the real problems ofbourgeois society.

When Hegel now comes to examine the rclauonship between modern civil society and the individual he finds his old Berne problem of positivity standing in his way. In their struggle agamst the social order of feudal absolutism the humanists came to conceive of civil society as the world freely created and owned by men themselves. Undoubtedly they had many illusions about this world. The actual emergence of a developed bourgeois society in France and England gave a new twist to both these convictions and to the illusions accompanying them. Society appeared even more strongly as the product and moreover the constantly re-created product ofmankind's own activity. At the same time, society engendered a whole series of manifestations, forms oflife and institutions that confronted the individual with a dead objectivity which inhibited his personal development and killed off everything that the humanists postulated as essential for the individual and for relations between individuals. As bourgeois ideologists the outstanding German humanists ofthe age found themselves compelled to accept the general foundations of the society that had come into being. But at the same ume they were implacably opposed to all that was dead and deadening m it. However, their opposition, their criticism never went beyond the horizon of bourgeois society itself, at least it never did so directly. On the contrary, their efforts were directed towards the discovery of forms of subjective activity, the creation oftypes ofhuman beings and forms oflifc with whose aid all that was dead and deadening could be annulled within the framework of bourgeois society. Goethe's great novel- Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship is the greatest poetic expression of these aspirations. And the appearance of Faust thirty years later testifies to Goethe's life-long struggle with this antagomsm between humanism and bourgeois society in the context of the solutions available at that stage of history. It is not by chance that Pushkin described Faust as the 'Iliad ofour age'.

In Frankfurt we see how Hegel's view of the problem of positivity shifted in this direction. In Berne the problem had been dealt with entirely in the context of the philosophy of society and history: positivity had appeared to Hegel to be the product of the decline of mankind symbolized by the emergence of Christianity and civil society. In his view only the revolutionary rebirth of the republics ofantiqmty could lead to the abolition of positivity. Such a revolution would be sudden and its success total, for in his v1ew the ancient city-states in their prime were completely free ofanything resembling positivity.

The question now presents itselfdifferently. His new starting-point 1s the life ofthe individual. The individual lives in a society which abounds in positive institutions, pos1t1ve relations between men and indeed men who have been deadened by positivity and transformed into objects. Hence the question has ceased to be: how can this positive soCiety be smashed and replaced by a radically different type of society? On the contrary, the questwn he now poses is this: how can the individual in this society lead a human life, i.e. how can the positivity in himself, m other people and in his relations to people and things be eliminated? Thus the social problem is transformed into one of individual morality, into the problem of what shall we do? How shall we live? And the underlying a1m here is to bring about a reconciliation with bourgeois society and a (perhaps partial) abolition of its positive character. (This seemmgly brings Hegel closer to the Kantian ethic than he had been in Berne. But we shall see later that this greater proximity only serves to bnng the actual philosophical disagreements between Kant and Hegel out mto the open.)

The category which provided a focus for Hegel's philosophical interests throughout this period was love. Here, once again, we find a category which seems to establish a certain link between the young Hegel and Feuerbach (even though Feuerbach could have had no knowledge of these early works ofHegel's which had not yet been published). Since a number of modern philosophers (such as Lowith) attach great importance to the alleged similanties between Feuerbach and the young Hegel, it is necessary to establish their opposition on this point. For however vague and dubious Feuerbach's ethics oflove may be, however much 1t tends to lapse mto idealism (as Engels has convmcingly demonstrated) it yet remains true that, epistemologically, the relationship between I and Thou on which it is based is conceived m the spirit of materialism. What counts for Feuerbach is that the Thou is independent of the consciousness ofthe I. His ethics oflove does mdeed lapse into idealist excesses, it does obscure the contradictions of bourgeois society, but for all that it does stand firmly on a materialist base: Its recognition that all objects (and hence all other people) are independent of my consciousness. By contrast, for Hegel the enure meaning oflove is that through it just this independence is overcome. The fundamental idealistic flaw in Hegel's conception of positivity is that it can be overcome only by overcoming objectivity itself and from this it follows that every objectivity not directly produced by consciousness must contain an element of positivity. This defect is particularly m evidence in his rhapsodically mystical conception oflove and makes the transition into religion inevitable.

'Religion is one with love. The beloved is not opposed to us, he is at one with out very being; in him we see only ourselves——and then he is agam not us——he is a miracle beyond our comprehension. '8 We can see that the two conceptions of love rest on diametrically opposed theories ofknowledge. But this must not blind us to the fact that the concept oflove is in neither case an accidental phenomenon and that its social foundations are similar in both thinkers. However, its social significance is different and this is because of the 40-years' interval separating the two and the consequent differences in the state of the economy and the class struggle. In both instances love is a vague idealistic concept embodying the humanistic, bourgems and revolutionary demand for a many-sided, fully developed human being who enjoys correspondingly rich, developed, many-sided and human relations with his fellow humans. On the other hand, the vagueness, the idealistic extravagance of the notion is a symptom of their mistaken belief that these aspirations can be realized within bourgeois society. In the 1 840s, however, when the proletarian movement was already gathering momentum and the era of scientific socialism was being born such a delusion meant something quite different from what it meant at the turn of the nineteenth century. When the followers ofFeuerbach among the 'True' socialists attempted to make his ethics of love yield socialist conclusions they inadvertently revealed the narrow reactionary illusions implicit in the category.

But at the time when Hegel was concerned with the problem there was no such sharp conflict with the progressive tendencies of the age. As we shall see, in the course ofhis later development Hegel came to adopt a much more comprehensive and realistic attitude towards bourgeois society. But at this stage the mysticism and muddle of his Frankfurt wn-tmgs was an essential step towards grasping its contradictory nature. And just because the concept of love has such a transitional character we must regard it in a different light.

Furthermore, we must bear in mind that in the Germany ofthe time it simply was not possible to see through the illusory nature of the categor ies that clothed universal human aspirations in the language of idealism. Economically backward as Germany was it was not possible to define the progressive nature of capitalism in purely economic terms as the classical English economists did. The realization that progress lay in the development ofthe material forces of production could only be attained in England itself, and even there it had to wait some decades for its supreme formulation from a bourgeois standpoint, m the works of Ricardo. But ifthe advanced development of the English economy could give birth to the supreme achievements of classical economic theory, it also prevented the conscious dialectical formulation ofthe contradictions and antagonisms in capitalism. It is true that Smith and Ricardo did not shnnk Gom giving expression to all the contradictions that they perceived and they present their views with the unhesitating love of truth typical of all major thinkers; they are unperturbed if one perceived fact conflicts with another equally well-established one. Hence Marx is quite right when he writes ofRicardo:

'With the master what is new and significant develops vigorously amid the "manure" of contradictions, out of the contradictory phenomena. The underlying contradictions themselves testify to the richness of the living foundation from which the theory itself developed. '9

But contradictoriness is only present matenally, as it were de jacto, and nothing could be further from the mmds ofthe classical English economists than to fix on contradiction as the fundamental fact of economic life and hence ofthe methodology of political economy.

But the awareness that life is based on contradictions is the fundamental problem faced by classical German literature and philosophy. Since their startmg-point is the contradiction between their humamst ideals and a bourgeois reality full of the vestiges of feudalism it is true of them too that the 'manure of contradictions' forms the basis of their problems and solutions. The entire range of human existence becomes their theme; they can experience, shape and think through all the contradictions that arise within this great complex. Since the economic basis of these contradictions does not and cannot become visible to them they lose themselves m idealist speculations. But by the same token, smce the intellectual side of this movement is consciously lived through, i.e. since their startmg-point is the living expenence of contradictoriness, of one contradiction arising from the solution of its predecessor, their path leads them to the first, if idealistic, formulation ofdialectics.

The antithesis between truly living human beings developing all their talents and human beings in bourgeois society who arc deformed mto the automata ofthe world ofcommodities and reduced to one-sided 'specialists' performmg a single narrow function within the capitalist division of labour——this antithesis forms the ground theme of Goethe's Wilhelm Meister. It is not just exemplified in the contrast between Wilhelm and Werner, his boyhood friend and a businessman. It can be seen also m Goethe's presentation of art and m particular of the theatre where he brilliantly depicts the destructive effects of the division of labour on a wide range of people. Moreover, it is typical of the state of Germany at the time that Goethe does not entirely reject religious solutions to these contradictions. The life of the canoness described in the Confessions of a Beautiful Soul gives a moving account of such a solution in which a sensitive woman holds herself alooffrom ordinary life with the aid of religwn while through love she sustams a living human relationship with her fellow human bemgs. Of course, the religious solution is by no means Goethe's final word. On the contrary, the canoness is compared unfavourably with those who enter into the ordinary life of the capitalist world. The ideal figures m the novel are Lothario and Nathalie who succeed in sustaining the human vitality oflove whilst actively participating in the ordinary life ofbourgeois society.

While in Frankfurt Hegel could not achieve anything comparable to this. The religwus solution played a far more prominent part m his thought during this transitional phase: 1t was accepted much more uncritically and a higher histoncal and human value was placed on it. But we shall sec that even here the contrast is not as great as it first seems.

With a forthrightness more typical ofhis Berne writings Hegel begins by opposing the subjective, the human and the living to the objective, the dead and the positive. But his new approach now increasingly dissolves these ngid opposites into flexible and elasuc contradictions. On the one hand, this increases the opaque mysticism of his thought; throughout the enure period m Frankfurt religion remams the authentic sphere ofreal life, oftrue vitality and of the genuine negation of what is dead and 'positive'. On the other hand, the concrete oppositions of the subjective and the objective give rise to a senes of increasingly complex contradictions which point in a quite different direction from the religious sphere.

What w<; have here in fact is the discrepancy noted by Engels between Hegel's system and his method. More precisely this discrepancy can be located m the critique, which long remained unconscious and, as it were, dormant, of the religious solution to contradictions. As we shall see, what Hegel is seeking in religion is the highest form oflove, i.e. a reality permeated with human subjectivity and cleansed of all social positivity. But the very process ofgiving up his earlier hostility to Christianity leads to a situation in which those features of Chrisuamty and of religion in general which are hostile to life and which preach escape from life present themselves with increasing vividness to his mind. And since his foremost aim is to reconcile the individual with the concrete reality of society as it is, he must inevitably become more and more aware of the weaknesses in the religious attitude. The trouble with it is that it does nothing to mitigate, let alone eliminate, the posmvity of the world as it is, and that in consequence it is simply a complement of that positivity. Hence seen in this light religwus subjectivity is merely another way of surrendering one's full humamty.

'If dependence on an object constitutes one pole, then the other extreme is fear of the objects, flight from them, fear of union with them, extreme subjectivity. '10

The view that pure subjectivity, flight from the objects into religion, is on the same plane as positivity is a view destined to play a crucial role in Hegel's Frankfurt period. As we shall see, it introduces a contradiction into Hegel's view ofChristianity and, in particular, ofthe life and teaching ofJesus. And looking beyond Frankfurt we shall find Hegel arguing inJena that Fichte's subjective idealism and French materialism are two false extremes which nevertheless represent equally important tendencies ofthe age.

For the time being, however, he draws no significant conclusions. His chief interest is to give a highly critical picture of those men who have fallen victim to the forces of positivity and conversely to praise the redemptive power oflove.

'Since something dead here forms part of the love relationship, love is girt by matter alone, and this matter is quite indifferent to it ... and while the objects by which he is confronted change, they are never absent . . . this is the ground ofhis tranquillity in the face of loss and his sure confidence that his loss will be made good because it can be made good. This attitude makes matter something absolute in man's eyes; but, of course, ifhe never existed, then nothing would exist for him, and what necessity was there for his existence? That he might wish to exist is intelligible enough, because beyond that collection of restricted experiences which make up his consciousness there is nothing whatever . . . but a bleak void and man cannot bear to think himselfin that nullity. '11

This rather ponderous and confused account of the state of mind of the average man in bourgeois society is now followed by a statement of Hegel's ideal of love. For man in bourgeois society the entire world consists of impenetrable, incomprehensible objects mechanically separated from men and from each other; he drifts among them in empty, unsatisfying activity. He has no real, substantial relationship with the objects, with his fellow-men or even with himself. Love, on the other hand, is in Hegel's eyes the principle that transcends these dead barriers and creates living relationships between men and this in turn serves to transform men into living things for themselves.

'True union, or love proper, exists only between living beings who are alike in power and thus in one another's eyes living beings from every point ofview; in no respect is either dead for the other. ... In love the separate does still remain, but as something united and no longer as something separate and the living senses the living. '12

It is indicative of the continuity in Hegel's development that a number of expressions in these extracts go back not just to Berne but,

117 more specifically, to the excerpts from Forster. Instances are the emphasis on the necessity for equality between lovers, the assertion m the passage followmg our quotation that man in bourgcms soncty 1s subject to an alien power from whom he implores mercy in fear and trembling. However, such expressmns have undergone a change ofmeaning. Equality for Forster and for Hegel at the ume when he made the excerpts meant above all political equality. Now, however, Hegel is much more concerned about equality ofbehavwur or attitude towards society. The social content of equality, namely equal power, acqmrcs, as we shall sec at once, a new, problematical dimension: it depends on the material, economic position of the lovers. But for the moment Hegel only poses this question m order to sweep it aside once more before advancmg towards the unity that abolishes all separateness between men and creates a truly unified life for them.

It is easy to understand why the reactionary nco-Hcgelians of the Age oflmpenalism should have attempted to make capital from the emphasis Hegel gave to such categoncs as love, life, etc. Eager to transform Hegel mto a Romantic philosopher of life (Lebensphilosoph) they ignore the transitional phase of cnsis in Frankfurt and seize upon the categories which arise from it, but which later disappear from his writmgs, m order to give a Romantic, vitalist mtcrpretation to his entire oeuvre. But quite apart from the inadmissibility ofthis extrapolation such an interpretation does not even fit the Frankfurt penod properly. Even in Frankfurt Hegel was no Rpmantic. It is not for nothing that we have stressed the similarities between the humanism of his approach and that of Goethe and Schiller; the existence ofthese parallels should suffice to show the unten-ability ofthe legend.

When we come to speak of Hegel's stay in Jcna we shall sec how remote Hegel remamed from the aspirations of the Romantics even thoughJena was at the time the focal point ofthe Romanuc movement.

As for vitalism, the so-called philosophy oflifc, Hegel's own later writmgs make his hostility towards it quite clear. As early asJcna he vigorously cnticized Friedrich Heinnch Jacobi, the most typical representative of this tendency at the time, and he never abandoned his dislike of it. And even in Frankfurt, as a careful scrutiny of the fragments will show, he never really accepted the basic assumption of Lehensphilo-sophie, viz. the idea of'immediate knowledge'. It is true, of course, that Hegel was engaged in a conflict with the rationalist 'philosophy of reflection' of the day and the Frankfurt period in particular is full of the first great debate with the philosophy of Kant. In like fashion at the end of the Frankfurt penod when his conception of positivity had become more histoncal and dialectical, Hegel directed his crinmm at the rationalism of the Enlightenment. But this is not to say that he ever embraced the contemporary 'philosophy of life'. We must not allow oursdvcs to be led astray here by concepts such as 'love' and 'life'. Hegel's fimt biographer, Rosenkranz, was often guilty of over-simplification in his efforts to approximate Hegel's philosophy to the subjectiVC idealism of Kant, but since he was necessarily unfamiliar with recent philosophical movements he was able to sec more clearly than the later neo-Hegclians that what Hegel meant, in Frankfurt, by 'life' was basically the same as what, in Jena, he designated 'Sittlichkeit' (ethical life), I.e. the concrete totalitv of man's actions in societvY

It is quite true that Hegel docs oppose love to reflection in Frankfurt. However, he docs not follow the contemporary fashion of setting up 'immediate knowledge' as an absolute negation of reflection. Instead he proposes love as a dialectical annulment of the reflective stage. Obviously it would be wrong to imply that Hegel had consciously and consistently worked out this dialectical relationship at the bcgmning of his stay in Frankfurt. But his notes make it qmte clear that in his account of the relations between love and reflection he has a glimmering ofhis later definition of'Ajhehen' as both 'annul' and 'preserve'.

'This unity is therefore perfect life because in it even reflection gets its due; in the onginal, undeveloped umty the possibility of reflection, of cleavage, snll stood over against it; in this umty, however, umty and cleavage are united, they arc a simple living thing that had been opposed to itself (and still feels itself so oppmcd), but has not rendered this opposition absolute. In love one living being senses another living being. Thus m love all tasks, the self-destructive onc-sidcdncss of reflection and the infinite opposition of an unconsnous, undeveloped umty, are resolved.14

Such passages are significant not just as refutations ofthe distortions of the reactionary neo-Hegelians but because they give a clear indication of the stage Hegel had reached in his development. They show how rapidly the experienced contradiction with bourgeois society and the internal conflict with himself arising from it led Hegel to a dialectical understanding of contradiction. For him to emerge 'suddenly' as a fully-fledged dialectician all that he needed was to achieve self-consciousness about the ideas that had fought their way confusedly to the surface in the course of these arguments. It is this situation that explains why many bourgeois historians have greeted Hegel's 'sudden' matunty inJena with such astomshment.

But, of course, Hegel's development into a dialectician proceeded very unevenly. The mternal contradictions m his philosophical position can be seen most clearly on the issue of reflection. As we have seen, hi; conception oflove is designed to bring about the dialectical supersession of reflection, I.e. love is thought ofas existing on a higher plane than the origmal 'unconscious, undevdopcd umty' precisely because it contains reflection within it. But at the same time we find that Hegel's religious mysncism often gams the upper hand and at such times love appears as a total, ultunate 'union' from which every last trace of cleavage, of reflection has been eliminated. Such diametrically opposed solutions are m evidence not only m the earlier part ofthe Frankfurt penod but also right at the very end, in the Fragment of a System which concludes this phase of his development. And such contradictions can be found not only in his view of love but also m his view of the religious life even though the latter was supposed to resolve the contradictions in the former.

Hegel's efforts in the quoted passage to secure a dialectical resolution of the relationship between reflection and love is important in yet another respect, since it throws light on the social implications of the profound gulf separatmg him from the Romantics and vitalists of the day. When Hegel refuses to accept life as something immediately given and chooses to see it mstead as an objective which can only be achieved after the annulment and subsequent preservation of reflection, what he is after is a philosophical rescue action to preserve humanist ideals within capitalist society, a development or transfiguration of capitalist society which would make fully human relations a possibility. His emphasis on the need to preserve reflection while annulling it shows that unlike the reactionary Romanucs he did not yearn for a primitive pre-capitalist society, and unlike Schelling with his concept of'intellectual intuition', he did not imagine that any genume fulfilment or understanding of life could be achieved outside social relations, 'independently' of them, as it were, shaking them off and leaving them behind one. It is evident, and the subsequent history of German philosophy confirms it, that although each of these two tendencies frequently inveighed against the other they yet aspired to one and the same goal: to solve the contradictions of bourgeois society by reverting to a more pnmitive, pre-capitalist form of social organization (the philosophy of the post-1 8 I 5 Restoration). We have repeatedly drawn attention to the illusions cherished by Hegel and we shall later have occasion to criticize them when their social implications manifest themselves more concretely. Biit all these illusions are not enough to justify the establishment of a bond between Hegel and the reactionary Restoration of his day. For all his illusions Hegel went in an entirely opposed direction, socially and hence also philosophically.

Hegel's attitude to bourgeois society is most clearly expressed where he abandons his extravagant religious generalizations and his vague language of expenence and mvemgates the problem of love fimding fulfilment in the world of reality. This brings him at once to the problem of possessions and property. We should remind ourselves here that in Berne he had taken up a very general histoncal view of such matters: he held that the relatively equitable distribution of property formed the economic basis of republican liberty in antiquity, and that the growing inequality ofthe later classical period was the basis of its decline, of the corruption of the citoyen of antiquity into the modern bourgeois and the private individual. Hegel now finds himself compelled to scrutinize the problem of property in a more concrete fashion. At first he does so primitively in terms of mere experience. We know that in the course of his historical and political studies Hegel had collected economic data, too, but at this stage this was a mere heap of empirical information from which he made direct political inferences. In harmony with this his first mterest in property was to discover its immediate effects on the psychological and moral life of man. That is to say, he regarded property as something dead and 'positive', something mcapable of an organic connection with any livmg, subjective activity. The bond between property and labour was something that did not enter mto his thoughts dunng these years. He thought of property only asa means of enjoyment or, at best, ofpersonal power.

Obviously it was not really possible to establish a really livmg relationship between such a notion of property and the highly abstract subjectivity ofhis conception oflove. More mteresting is the fact that Hegel was at pains to establish such a relationship. He was aware that love must be realized m society as it is, i .e. by people who either do or do not own property and who for the most part own different amounts of it. And although he sees property as the home of death and positivity. i.e. as something diametrically opposed to love he docs make the attempt to study their interrelations.

'Yct the lovers are connected with much that is dead; external objects belong to each of them. This means that a lover stands in rdation to things that arc opposed to him in his own eyes as objects and opposites; this is why lovers arc capable of a mul tiplex opposition in the course of their multiplex acquisition and possession of property and right, . . . . Since possession and property make up mch an important part of men\ life, cares and thoughts, even lovers cannot rcfram from rcflcctwn on this aspect of their rdatiom.，15

Given the pnmitive nature of these economic concepts and the psychological interpretation of the relations between men and property Hegcl could not get beyond a supcrftnal compromise. What is important is that he saw that the problem itself could not be side-stepped. The solution he fixes on here is that lovers should own propertyjomtly.

But no less typical of Hegel's sober realism is his presentiment that this solution is illusory. In a marginal note on the passage just quoted he add,:

'By pooling their property . . . the joint ownen create the illmmn that their particular nght, have been annulled; at bottom, however, a right is retained to the part ofthe property that is not directly used; only this right is not asserted. Where property is held in common things are not the property of any one person, but ownership, the right to a portion is concealed in the relationship.，16

Thus Hegel perceives that the annulment of the positivity of property throughjoint-ownership on the part oflovers is no true annulment.

Hegel's realism, his uninhibited criticism and demolition of his own extravagant and tortuous conclusions is evident also in his occasional realization ofthe transitory, momentary nature oflove.

'This unity, (the child) however, is only a point; a seed; the lovers cannot so contribute to 1t as to make it a manifold in itself from the start. Their union is free from all inner division; in it there is no working on an opposite. Everything which gives the newly begotten child a manifold life and a specific existence, it must draw into itself, set over against itself, and unify with itself: *

The point is clear enough: even though Hegel places love in the very centre ofhis thought at this stage he is very far from glorifying it in the Romantic style. He regards it as the highest point ofexistence; it alone can overcome all that is dead and 'positive' in the world. At the same time he perceives that no higher reality can be based on it which would provide a real counter-weight to the positivity of bourgeois society. In the course ofhis later development in Frankfurt he treats the absence of love as an absence ofobjectivity. He desires to confront the dead positivity ofthe world with a non-positive, living objectivity. His old contrast of the two ages now becomes an internal contrast within bourgeois society. This leads to an attempt to elevate the non-positive objectivity of religion above the merely living subjectivity of love. We shall return later to the contradictions that result from this procedure. Here we need only mention that at this point he looks for and discovers another solution for the inadequacy of purely subjective love, a solution that remains decisive for his later socio-philosophical writings: love as the basis ofmarriage and the family. Immediately after the lines we have just quoted he adds:

'Thus the process is: umty, separated opposites, reunion. After their union the lovers separate again, but in the child their union has become unseparated.'

And to the word 'reunion' he appended this note:

'The child is the parents themselves. ' 17

Here, then, is the germ of Hegel's theory of the family as the nucleus of bourgeois society.

Thus through the confUsion and the contradictions of these early fragments it is possible to discern the first outlines of his view of society. More precisely, they enable us to glimpse the pressures and tendencies that led to his later conception of civil society. We shall see that the constant theme in his development is the search for a dialectical connection between the apparently lifeless objects and institutions of society, a connection that would divest objectivity of its deadness and allow it to become manifest as the premise and product ofthe activity of the subject, i.e. that would conceive of society and history as mankind's own world, the product of mans own activity. Up to now only the ftrst, very modest and rather obscure steps have been taken, and this applies both to the content and the method. Hegel's knowledge of the structure of modern civil society is still very vague, very empirical and far removed from any grasp ofits underlying laws. And parallel with this his method is scarcely more than a vague search for the living connections between the subject and the objective world of society. Presentiments of the dialectical interconnections occur from time to time and are then lost in the mvstical

• haze ofreligion.

His ruling pnnciple at this time was still the rigid opposition ofsubject and object; though there was too the passionate desire to overcome its dualism. Right from the start of his stay in Frankfurt Hegel looked for a mode of activity m bourgeois society that would sausfy his humanist ideals and would nevertheless lead to activity within bourgeois society. His philosophical formula was to lead to a revitalization of society from within and not by importing any extraneous pnnciple into society; the dead machinery was to be brought to life. The road from death to life. however, turns out to be the road which leads to the discovery of all the contradictions in bourgeois society, albeit with the intention of resolving them within that society itself. This is the road on which Hegel seeks the reconciliation of mankind, of the ideals of humanity with bourgems society, and right from the start, as soon as these problems emerge, we arc m a position to perceive both the strengths and weaknesses of Hegel's view of societv.

Given its rather confused basis in emotion and expenence, Hegel's present emphasis on vitality must inevitably lead him straight mto the arms ofreligion. We have already noted his greater affimty with Christianity during this penod as contrasted with his bnsk rejection of it m Berne. If, as we have argued, love is now identical with religwn, or, a., he will soon formulate the matter, iflove is the road to religion, then it is clear that reconciliation with Christianity is the goal he is making for. Here too we find him taking a direction that he will adhere to his whole life long. It would be going too far, however, to take all too literally the reactionary interpretations, which derive ultimately from the right-Hegelians among his own pupils, to the effect that Hegel was, or became, the philosopher of Protestantism. (In recent years Georg Lasson has taken up this theme with great enthusiasm and has criticized even the most reactionary neo-Hegelians if they ventured to 'underestimate' the strength ofHegel's Protestantism.)

Hegel's relations with Chnstianity were never unambiguous or free from contradictions or reservations. In the course of our study of the Frankfurt penod we shall see that he was forced to get to grips with Christianity and above all with the personality of Its founder, and that the religious categories of Christianity are of the highest importance for his entire philosophy. But we shall also see that his analysis culminates in the discovery of an msoluble tragic contradiction in the life and teaching ofJesus, and further, that the climax of Hegel's religious thought at this time is not by any means to be equated with Christianity. On the contrary, as late as Jena we shall still encounter fragments on the development of the various religions which go beyond Christiamty and look forward to the birth of a new third faith. When we come to look at these later writings we shall have occasion to point out the ambiguities in his view of Christianity and religion in general, ambiguities that characterize even his very last statements on this problem. But for an understanding of the present phase it is enough if we establish that Hegel has abandoned his earlier rejection of Christianity and if, on the other hand, we mamtain that what Hegel was looking for in religion m Frankfurt was that living unity of contradictions which represented the highest form oflife to him at a time when his thought was rapidly maturing. The contradictory nature of this view inspired his basic line at the time: the tendency to absorb philosophy into religion. (The reversal ofthis process is one of the outstanding changes that took place in his thought inJena.)

The new view ofChristianity is not without its effect on his general philosophical and historical position. We shall just indicate briefly the most important changes. In Berne the historical scheme he had favoured was one in which the collapse of freedom in the city-states of antiquity

had led to the decadent age of Christiamty. In this process the Jewish origins of Christianity had been given the subordinate role of an immediate cause. The decisive factor was the political, economic and moral decay ofthe Roman Empire. As the progenitor ofthe religion ofthe new epoch in world history theJews were treated only as a nation of equal degeneracy, able therefore to bring into being a religion that would supply the needs of a degenerate mankmd. Now, however, Hegel begins to take a greater interest in the origins ofJudaism and he devotes more attention to the similanties and differences between Judaism and Christianity. This extension ofhis historical interests is the first step towards his later philo

sophy ofhistory in which the history ofclassical antiquity is preceded by a lengthy analysis of the Orient. In the early years ofhis stay in Frankfurt his treatment of the Orient has relatively little to do with history. It involves little more than an his-torico-philosophical analysis of Jewish traditions as contained in the Bible. Nevertheless, a number of points emerge that will be important for his later historical views. For example, his analysis proceeds from the premise that the Jews differ from the Greeks primarily because of their 'estrangement from nature'. We have here the germ ofhis later view of the East, but even apart from that there is the very remarkable, if rather elliptical aphorism that this estrangement (Entzweiung)

'necessarily results in the birth ofthe state etc'.18

What is important for Hegel's later development is the perception that the state comes into being when the contradictions in society reach a certain point. In Berne the state of antiquity appeared to him to be the product of an age without internal social contradictions; it was the emergence and intensification of contradictions that led to the downfall of the state. Here we see the seeds of his later more dialectical and historical view, albeit in an inflexible and highly mystified form.

We can see the change in his views ofthe historical role ofthe state and the relationship of the citizen to the state even more clearly in another passage from the same fragment, The Spirit ofjudaism. In order to understand it fully we must remind ourselves ofHegel's view in Berne. He had held then that people can only be said to have a relation to the state n a democratic republic in which the citoyen freely gives himself to it. The state may be said to be in decay when despotism rules and the citizens are purely private individuals incapable of any relation to it. Now, too, he emphasizes the utter contrast between the republics of antiquity and the Jewish theocracy. But at the same time he talks of the establishment of the kingdoms ofJudah and Israel in these terms:

'The individual was entirely excluded from an active interest in the state; the political equality of the citizens was the reverse of republican equality, it was only the equality of insignificance. Not until the Kings do we find, together with the inequality that they introduced, a defmite relation to the state on the part of many subordinates; many acquired a significance with respect to those beneath them and for some there was at least the possibility of acquiring such a significance.'19

This passage, too, is very confused, but so much is clear that Hegel now believed that the greater mequality under the monarchy did create stronger bonds with the state than the earlier, abstract equality of the pri-minve theocracy.

In other words, Hegel now begins to see that the classes and estates that arise m the course of history have an essential, determinmg influence on the relations between people and the state. In Berne he had regarded all class differentiations as symptoms of fragmentation and the decline of the state. Now, when he is striving to understand the nature of modern civil society he must obviously realize that the real links joinmg the vanous classes and estates in a simple whole are a constitutive part of modern society. He does not grasp this fully until the Jena period and this view does not receive its final definition until much later, in the Philosophy of Right in 1821. But it is important to see the germ of this idea in these early discussions ofcivil society.

Our last quotation shows that Hegel held fast to the evaluation of political life of antiquity that he had worked out in Berne. Nor was he to modify it later on; the only thing that does change is the place of antiquity in his historical scheme. He comes increasingly to regard classical civilization as something irretrievably lost, and this goes hand in hand with his growing understanding of the necessary origins and determinants ofmodern society.

In Frankfurt, however, his dominant religious bias creeps into his view ofantiquity. In the search for a religious, non-positive objectivity Hegel harks back to Greek religion and sees in its animism a model for his own aspirations. But more interesting than that is his advance from that line of thought to a consideration of the problems ofnccesstty and contingency, ofsubject and object.

'Where subject and object—— r freedom and nature arc thought of as unified, so that nature is freedom and subject and object are inseparable, there is the divine; such an ideal is the goal of every religion. A deity is at once subject and object; one may not say ofit that it is a subject in contrast to the objects, or that it has objects. Theoretical systems become entirely objective, opposed to the subject; practical activity destroys the object and is entirely subjective—in love alone is one at one with the object; it neither exercises mastery, nor is it mastered. This love, transformed by the imagination into essence, is the deity. . . . Every union can be called the union of subject and object, offreedom and nature, ofthe real andpossible. '7l

We see here how Hegel's first attempts to formulate dialectical problems at once result in his deployment of the form of objective idealism current in German philosophy: the identical subject-object. His terminology, too, brings him close to Schelling and Fichte's theory of knowledge, both of which he retains in their essentials, while pressing forward to a more objective dialectics than them. It is not very important to establish here the extent to which Hegel was influenced by Schelling or whether it is simply the case that he spontaneously went in the same direction. For, given the kinds of questions that led to absolute idealism m Germany the idea of the identical subject-object was unavoidable. What is vital is the way m which different thinkers annul and preserve the subject and the object in a higher unity. Depending on how this is done absolute idealism either loses itself completely in religious mysticism (as with Schelling), or else it elaborates and maintams the livmg contradictions with enough vigour to force the idealist mysticism to yield up a significant understanding of reality. The struggle between these two tendencies occupies the whole ofHegel's development. From time to time Schelling's mfluence strengthens the retrograde tendency. His polemics against Schelling and the eventual parting of the ways pomt to the tnumph of the other, even though in the framework of absolute idealism the victory can never be ffnal.

However that may be, the fact remans that these fragments reveal an intense preoccupation with philosophical problems that was wholly absent m Berne. It is very charactensuc ofhis present state that the notion of objectivity had become highly volatile and that he struggles with vanous formulations without reaching a satisfactory conclusion. For mstance, it is interesting to sec m the passage just quoted how he gives a subjective mterpretation of the religiosity which in his view is destined to abolish the antagonism between subject and object. What he does is, as it were, to import subjectivity mto the objects by means ofthe imagination, i.e. a procedure which, taken to its logical conclusion, can have no real impact on objectivity. His uncertainty at this stage is expressed above all in his wish to fimd a form of bemg in life, in religion that is higher than all ideas and concepts, a form of being that will do away with all the limitations and ngidities ofreflection.

In the course of his mvestigation of these concepts Hegel stumbles on the idea that existence is independent of consciousness, but since he holds fast to his idealist theory of knowledge, the insight cannot be profitably exploited.

'This independence, this absoluteness ofbemg is the stumbling-block; it must no doubt exist, but its mere existence does not mean that it exists for m. Thus the independence of bemg means that it just is, whether for us or not: bemg must be simply something separate from us, something in which a relationship with us is not necessarily implied.'

Hegel deduces various conclusions from this. Earlier on he says: 'Faith presupposes bcmg', and he evidently wishes to estabhsh the pnonty of bemg over thought. At the same time, he wants to discover in faith that higher religious pnnciple with whose aid the objective ideal unity may be estabhshed. Hence he concludes:

'what is, must not be believed, but whatever is believed, must exist.'

These arguments are extraordinarily confUsed, but one thing docs emerge from them, namely that the problems of the theory of knowledge, of objectivity are all in flux. And it is of great interest to see that it is m this context that we can discover the germs of the later dialectical distinctions within bemg (Sein, being, Dasein, being-in-the-world or determinate being, Existenz, existence). Of course, the distmctions have not been properly worked out. But it is of the greatest importance that these problems all emerge in the context ofthe central problem ofBerne, the problem ofpositivity. The connection between the social problem of positivity and the philosophical problem of objectivity had been unconscious and instinctive m Berne, but it now starts to preoccupy Hegel actively. And it is no coincidence that at the same ume the old conception ofpositivity now becomes unstable and that contradictions begm to anse within it.

Hegel's defimtion ofpositivity m Frankfurt corresponds exactly to the defimtion he had given in BerneY But m the course of his studies it becomes more concrete, the deffnition ts now more consciously philosophical and hence more flexible. Throughout this penod Hegel was concerned, as we have seen, to achieve an existmg, living umon of the opposites, the antagomsms of life. In this context posiUvity now appears to him as a false union.

'Wherever there is eternal cleavage in nature and the irreconcilable is united, there is positivity.'

And elaboratmg on the ideas about faith and being already cited, he now deffmes positivity in this way:

'A positive faith is one which, instead of the only possible umon, posits another; mstead of the only possible being it posits a different one. Thus it unites that which is opposed in such a way that the union it achieves is incomplete, i.e. things arc not united in the way they should be. '23

It is mteresting to note how here, as earlier on with the distinction between bemg and consciousness, Hegel is driven to the outer edge of idealism, but at once turns around and hurls himself into the arms of subjectivity. For if we read the above quotations carefully, bearing in mind that by 'life' Hegel means the union of opposites in bemg, it is evident that positivity means more or less what a materialist would call the false reflections of objective reality. At the decisive moment, however, he reverses his direction and introduces the word 'should' without making it clear with what the syntheses of positive faith would or should not agree. And the same uncertainty makes itselffelt when he goes on to say:

'Positive faith requires faith in something that does not exist. '24

And he strengthens this formulation by turning the contrast of positive and non-positive faith into a contrast between idea and being.

'In positive religion being, union is only an idea, something thought ——I believe that it exists means: I believe the idea, I believe that I can imagine something, I believe in something believed (Kant, deity). Kanuan philosophy—positive religion (deity a holy will, man an absolute negation; in the idea is united, ideas are united——an idea is a thought, but thoughts do not exist——)15

As he develops the concept more concretely he will abandon this view of positivity as mere idea. But the importance of these first attempts to formulate the concept ofpositivity is that they show Hegel's thought in a state of flux and that, as we have seen, the vanous gradations of being are making their appearance on the horizon. One final factor of interest is that this interpretation of positivity has suddenly brought the differences between Kant and Hegel to the surface and this in turn provides the first stimulus to Hegel's critique ofKantian philosophy.

### Chapter 3 Fragments of two pamphlets on current German problems
That the municipal authorities of Wurttemberg should he elected hy its citizens and The German Constitution.

The contradictions in Hegel's position at this penod are well illustrated by two fragmentary pamphlets written in 1798/9.

The first pamphlet was concerned with constitutional conflicts in Hegel's own land ofWiirttemberg. It must have been written in the first half of 1798 since Rosenkranz has published a letter by a friend ofHegel's replying to it and this is dated 17 August I 798; clearly the pamphlet must have been completed by then.1

Hegel wrote his pamphlet in the course of the constitutional struggles that raged at the end of the century between the Duke of Wiirttemberg and his Estates. They fell out on the issue of what attitude to adopt towards France. The Duke supported the Austnan intervention while the Estates sympathized with the French. After the Duke had attempted to subject the country to absolute rule without the Estates he had to summon them again in 1796 to elect a new Council (Landesausschuss) which the Duke hoped would be more tractable. But he was disappointed and the conflict just became more acute. In the course of the struggle a large number of pamphlets were published criticizing the obsolete feudal conditions still obtainmg in Wiirttemberg and also the antiquated constitution and they even went as far as to demand a representative assembly to be elected by the entire population. There were even said to be republican tendenoes and there were calls for a Swabian republic.

Hegel's pamphlet was his contribution to the debate. The surviving fragments show very clearly his hesitant attitude on issues of the moment. Not that he was guilty of any compromise with feudal and absolute conditions in Germany, let alone of capitulation to them. Where he can remam at the level of criticism or philosophical generalization he shows great resoluteness in attacking condiuons in Germany. And m this sense it cannot be said that his political opinions reveal any significant change. His mtention is to intervene m the urgent questions of the day but wherever he attempts to tackle a concrete issue he displays the greatest uncertamty, his judgment falters and he finally comes up with

surprisingly moderate proposals given his premises. The great critical run-up ends with relatively tame proposals for reform, as indeed Haym pointed out long ago.2

This uncertainty can be seen clearly m the changes made in the title of the pamphlet. Originally it read That the municipal authorities of Wurttemberg should be elected by its people. 'People' was later changed in favour of 'citizens'. The ffnal vemon, however, ran as follows: On the most recent domestic affairs of Wurttemberg and on the municipal constitution in particular. The pamphlet originally bore a dedication 'To the people of Wiirttemberg', but this was later deleted.3 We can no longer determme whether these emendations were made to forestall censorship or because Hegel had changed his views; nor do we know whether and to what extent they are bound up with changes in the text. All we can do is analyse the rather meagre fragments that have survived.

Hegel's starting-point is very close to the republicanism he had adhered to in Berne and also in the Cart translation. The fragments published by Haym contain extremely derogatory statements about absolutism. For instance, he says that in an absolutist state

'all turns ultimately around one man who unites all powers within himself ex providentia majorum and there is no guarantee that he will recognize and respect the rights ofman'.

And in harmony with this he states:

'The whole representative system of Wiirttemberg is faulty and in need of thorough-going reform. '4

His criticism here has its basis in an appeal to justice and to the rights of man.

'In this view justice is the only measure. The courage to enforce justice is the only power that can clear away the tottering structure honourably and calmly, and bring about a secure state of affairs.，5

Only this striving for justice, only an attempt to raise oneself onto the plane of the universal will overcome the petty, particular interests of the philistines.

In his introductory remarks to the fragments Hegel gives a vivid picture of the growing desire for reform in Wiirttemberg. He describes the mood as irresistible and argues that each delay will only increase it.

'It is no accidental vertigo that will pass. Call it delirium, but it can end only with death or the expulsion of the disease. It is the travail of tht; health that remains to drive out the evil. '6

Hegel then reasserts that conditions in Wiirttemberg have reached breaking-point and are in need of complete revision.

He turns scornfully on the people who concede that reforms are necessary but who are prevented by class-interest from lending support to any concrete proposal.

'All too often such desires and the zeal for the common good conceal the reservation "insofar as it coincides with our own interest". Their willingness to give their consent to all improvements takes fright and fades away as soon as a demand is made upon them.'

And his satirical comments on the necessity for political reforms are summed up with the words:

'If there is to be a change, then something must be changed. We must assert this bald truth simply because the fear that is forced to act differs from the courage that wills to act in that, when the time to act arrives, people who are driven by fear are so weak that they wish to retain all they happen to possess. They are like the spendthrift who 1s forced to regulate his expenditure; every item that he is advised to give up now appears indispensable and he refuses to deprive himself of any, until the moment comes when both his necessities and luxuries are taken away from him. '7

Why has the situation in Wiirttemberg become untenable? Hegel's answer is clear and simple. Because its institutions are the inheritance of an earlier age now past and are socially and politically obsolete; they can no longer satisfy the needs or the spirit of the modern world. We may regard this as the typical progressive bourgems attitude towards the insu-tutions of feudal absolutism in Germany. At the same time they are not without significance, since they point to a great advance in Hegel's own historical and philosophical thought. For the first time Hegel employs the idea ofhistorical development in the defence of social progress.

In Berne he had looked to the resurrection of the republics of antiquity m the midst of a world made degenerate by Christian positivity and the inequality of wealth; this resurrection was to come about by a Cuvier-like catastrophe. Now, tentatively and abstractly as yet, he begins to realize that the development of society is itself the impetus to progress. In consequence he starts to consider the various institutions of politics and society from a more historical perspective. That is to say, he no longer Sards an institution as good or bad in itself, as he had done in Berne, he realizes that an institution that was originally good may come to impede progress in the course oftime. Thus Hegel accounts for the obsolescence ofinstitutions in Wiirttemberg in this way:

'They are blind who would believe that institutions, constitutions and laws from which the spirit has flown and which no longer accord with the customs, the needs and opmions of men, can continue to survive, and that forms which have ceased to exert any hold over feeling and reason can be powerful enough to bind a nation together!'8

Here we can see the great importance of his complex and unresolved ideas about his new definition of positivity which we discussed in the previous chapter. At that stage we could only show that Hegel's onginal rigid definition was now in a state of flux, that the inflexible antinomies of positivity and non-positivity had begun to break down into dialectical transitions. What Hegel had formulated shortly before in terms of true or false union now gains in historical concreteness: he now calls positive 'that from which the spirit has flown'. He is no longer content to ask what is or is not positive. He is now concerned with the question: how does an institution become positive ? We shall see how this novel, consciously historical and philosophical version of positivity has been deepened by the end of the Frankfurt penod and how it becomes the foundation for Hegel's mature philosophy of history. The present truncated state of the fragments does not permit us to draw any conclusions about the stage he had reached when he wrote the pamphlet and whether he had made any definite connection between the ideas quoted above and the problem of positivity. The most that can be said is that a few small extracts in Haym do suggest that there was a connection of some sort. But apart from a few words Hegel's original text Haym only gives his own highly abbreviated version. Thus he says:

'With hard-hitting words he describes and rebukes the officialdom that "has lost all sense of the innate rights of man and, trotting in the rear of the advancing age, caught between the claims of office and conscience, it can think of nothing but the need to find historical justification for positive institutions'' '?

Thus there does seem to have been a connection of a sort between positivity and historical obsoleteness in the original pamphlet, but the surviving texts do not permit us to determine how conscious and clear it was.

This quotation from Haym also points to another important, practical aspect of the pamphlet: the vigorous attack on the absolute bureaucracy of Wiirttemberg. In a further fragment Hegel also speaks witheringly of the bureaucratic apparatus of the petty absolutist state. He perceives indignantly that this apparatus is in fact much more powerful than the Estates.

'Thus the officials . . . led the Council and with it the nation by the nose. '10

These comments are important because they show that Hegel was not just sharply critical of the feudal clements in the Wiirttemberg constitution, but that he was no less hostile to the absolutist state which was at that moment in conflict w1th the feudal Estates. It is evident then that Hegel's objective could only be something radically different, viz. the bourgeois democratic transformation of the country.

All the more disappointing, therefore, are the vague and timorous concrete proposals that he puts forward. After his scathing attack on con-diuons in Wiirttemberg, after his histoncal and phildophical justification of the need for radical change it is something of an anti-climax to hear him ask the question 'whether in a country which has had an hereditary monarchy for centuries it is advisable suddenly to allow an unenlightened mob accustomed to blind obedience and dependent on the impression of the moment to choose its own representatives.' And his concrete proposals follow the tenor of these remarks rather than the sharp tone ofhis criticism of Wiirttemberg.

'As long as everything else remains unchanged, as long as the people does not know its rights, as long as there is no public spirit, as long as the power of the officials remains unrestrained, popular elections would only result in the complete overthrow of our constitution. The best solution would be to entrust the franchise to a body of enlightened and upright men independent of the court. But I do not see how an electoral system could be devised that would result in such an assembly, however carefully the active and passive franchise were determined. 111

The gulf between his critique of the existing situation and his timid and vague reforms is perfectly clear. We have seen how in Berne Hegel dissociated himself from the radical and plebeian wing of the French Revolution, but this is not enough to explain his reluctance to demand 'an independent' assembly of notables, even when we take into account the fact that he was writing in full knowledge of the experiences of the French Revolution and that he might have been afraid that an elected assembly would turn into a radical convention. For both in France and later even in Germany there were many moderate liberals who believed that an elected representative body would be the suitable vehicle for the reforms that had become necessary.

The true explanation lies in the general state of Germany and the ideological attitude arising from it which never ceased to determine Hegel,s position (as well as that of such important contemporaries as Goethe). Looking at Germany from a cosmopolitan point of view he could get a pretty clear idea both of its backwardness and of the constitution that it ought to have. But he had no idea how his critical insights were to be

transformed into political action. In consequence of his vagueness and uncertainty there arose in his mind a great vanety of socially necessary but more or less reactionary illusions which were to determme his thought throughout his life. The more concrete his approach to a problem, the wider the gulfbetween his vision and his political proposals appeared and the more illusory the purely ideological attempts to bridge it. Marx has analysed the social origins and character of these illusions m a brilliant section of The German Ideology. He charactenzes the political and economic fragmentation of Germany at the end of the eighteenth century in these words:

'The impotence of each separate sphere oflife (one cannot speak here of estates or classes, but at the most onlv of former estates and classes not yet born) did not allow any one of them to gain exclusive domination. The inevitable consequence was that during the epoch of absolute monarchy, which was seen here in its most stunted, semi-patriarchal form, the special sphere which, owing to the division of labour, was responsible for the work of administration of public interests acquired an abnormal independence, which became still greater in the bureaucracy of modern times. Thus, the State built itself up mto an apparently independent force, and this position, which in other countries was only transitory——a transition stage——has been mamtained in Germany until the present day. It is this position of the State which explains both the honesty of the civil servant that is found nowhere else, and all the illusions about the State which are current in Germany, as well as the apparent independence of German theoreticians in relation to the burghers——the seeming contradiction between the form in which these theoreticians express the interests of the burghers and these interests themselves.12

Even a superficial glance at Hegel's arguments reveals that he exhibits all the attributes of the German ideology ofhis age as described by Marx. No doubt, the illusions about the 'honesty of the civil servant' and about the state will only make their appearance later on, but the state's apparent independence of the real interests of the up-and-commg bourgems class is already the central pillar ofhis political and social methodology. This is the source both of the vagueness and timidity m his concrete proposals and ofhis illusions about an 'independent' body that would determine the constitution of Wiirttemberg. What is important here is his relationship with liberalism. As far as his social objectives are concerned, Hegel is largely in agreement with the liberals. It is apparent that he had made a thorough study of notable advocates ofliberalism like Benjamin Constant and Charles James FoxY Nevertheless, right up to the end of his life we see an increasingly explicit rejection of the political methods of liberalism, above all of the German liberals. In particular, he refuses to share their faith in elections, parliaments, parliamentary reforms, etc.

This paradox is a reflection of Germany's economic and social backwardness and the resulting development of political ideology which is divided, retarded, petty and philistme, rather thanjust uneven. Both of its principal currents are tainted by its philistinism as well as its vague utopianism. The German liberals of the day put their demands forward dogmatically for the most part, without any real attempt to take the actual balance of power within society into account. (To avoid any misunderstanding here when I speak of the ideologists of liberalism I explicitly exclude the few revolutwnary democrats such as George Forster.) Wherever the French mtervention had given rise to a form of pseudoconstitutionalism this dogmatic approach was combined with petty-bourgeois opportunism and with a very bigoted church policy (m South Germany). Like Goethe, Hegel1s fully aware of the narrow-mindedness of German liberalism. He does not share their mistaken assessment of the German situation nor of the socio-economic preconditions ofbourgeois society. But his correct criticism of them is often accompamed by different illusions of his own, illusions which later lead him to mcreasingly reactionary positions on particular issues.

Thus the prejudices and illusions of both points of view available at the time reflect the German misere. Even the ablest minds of Germany with the widest, most cosmopolitan horizon are defeated by the petty, philistine provincialism of German society. Not until just before and especially just after the July Revolution of 1830 in France do we witness the emergence of a definite democratic movement in Germany and with it the first efforts to overcome this provmcialism (Georg Buchner, Heine). But we need only think of the battles that the young Marx fought with the radical Young Hegelians to realize how deeply these provinoal ideologies were rooted in Germany.

Since Hegel's ideological assumptions were dictated ultimately by the class structure of Germany at the time he was unable ever to overcome them. It is true that he does acquire a much greater understanding of the forces that move society, and his knowledge of the underlymg laws becomes ever more profound. But only up to a certain pomt. There is always a point at which his concrete and clear grasp of class antagonisms comes to a halt and quite without any objective social justification turns into abstract generalizations which feed on illusions about the nature of the state and, later on, the bureaucracy. For all his life-long efforts to investigate the dialectical connections between the 'particularity' of private and class interests and their social product, the 'universal' is never logically developed from the real, particular social conditions; on the contrary, it is always imposed 'from above', idealistically, from a position apparently independent of class allegiances. It is evident that this fundamental contradiction is much less obvious here than in his later development. We shall also see great fluctuations in his political attitudes and his philosophical approach. But this fundamental contradiction is a persistent and indeed permanent feature of all his thought.

Hegel's pamphlet never appeared. A partial explanation is provided by a letter, published by Rosenkranz, from a friend of Hegel's in Stuttgart. In this letter the friend argues that publication at the present time would do more harm than good. Of the arguments he presents one is directed agamst Hegel's projected assembly of notables which the writer describes as arbitrary . More important, perhaps, was the disappointment felt by progress1ve and even revolutionary Germans with the outcome of the war w1th France. The Congress at Rastatt which sat from December 1797 to April 1798 and which brought the war of the first Coalition against France to an end resulted only in loss of territory for Germany. German patriots had cherished hopes that the wars of the French Republic would lead to the international spread of democratic mstitutions and were bitterly disappointed when the peace negotiations resulted in no more than petty haggling for various territories. This disappointment is reflected in the concluding lines of the letter to Hegel:

'Of course, my dear friend, our reputation has suffered greatly. The rulers of the grande nation have sacrificed the most sacred rights of mankind to the mockery and derision of our enemies. I know of no vengeance that would fit their crimes. In these circumstances the publication ofyour essay would be just one evil the more.'"

The contradiction which comes emotionally to the surface here is one we have already discussed. It lies at the roots of all the theoretical and practical attempts of the age to achieve the unification of Germany. Hegel gives his own solution to this question in his next pamphlet which he dtafted but did not complete. But it is interesting and very typical of Hegel that his notes do not show the least trace ofbitterness towards the french. He approaches the problem of German unity from the internal contradictions in German national history and his later detailed discussions of this issue and of world history in general show that he never atoned his sympathy for the developments in France; indeed, with the advent of Napoleon these sympathies only become more pronounced and he tended more and more to regard the Napoleonic solution to the problems of the French Revolution as paradigmatic. Of course, the gulfbetween his socio-historical analysis and his intended solution still remains unbridgeable.

This gulf can be seen in the surviving fragments of The German Constitution in the way in which the manuscript breaks off wherever a concrete proposal becomes inevitable. Hegel took up work on the pamphlet once more in Jena and greatly expanded both the critical and historical parts as well as those concerned with concrete proposals. But this just shifted the difficulty elsewhere and the gap between the theoretical and practical parts remained wider than ever. Thus when dealing with the past Hegel shows very clearly that all changes in political constitutions come about only because of the existence of real historical forces. But the Jena version of The German Constitution preserves a total silence on the subject of the historical forces that might bring about the reforms Hegel wishes to see introduced into Germany, and whenever he does allude to such forces he does so in a vague and mystificatory way.15

As to the first fragment, we are at once struck by the sharpness of his criticism and the boldness of his analysis in contrast to the absence of any concrete perspective. His study of the situation in Germany leads him to see the demise of Germany as a nation, its final fragmentation, as a very real threat. He does indeed hint at another, opposite solution, but the manuscript breaks off just as he is about to discuss it. For after an incisive critique of the autonomy of the different parts of Germany, Hegel goes on to say:

'If the tendency to become isolated is the only moving principle m the German Empire, then Germany is in the process of sinking inexorably into the abyss ofits dissolution, and to utter a warning of this would indeed be evidence of zeal, but also of folly since it would be wasted labour. Is Germany not standing at the cross-roads between the fate of Italy and unification in a single state? There are above all two factors that enable us to hope for the latter, two factors that we may regard as a counter to the principle of disintegration. '16

But the manuscript has nothing further to say about these two pnnciples.

We have already shown that Hegel's analysis reached this conclusion entirely from a consideration ofthe internal situation in Germany and he did not blame the French wars for the plight of the German Empire. Like all progressive Germans of the day Hegel saw the source of Germany's ills in the sovereignty of the greater and lesser principalities, in the fragmentation of Germany into a whole host of states of varying sizes. This leads him to the following very radical conclusion:

'Apart from despotisms, i.e. states with no constitution, no state has a more wretched constitution than Germany.'

And headds:

'Voltaire went so far as to call its constitution an anarchy; this is the best description if Germany is considered as a state; but even this name is no longer valid since Germany can no longer be regarded as a state in any sense.'17

The arguments Hegel adduces in support of this harsh judgment are mteresting and characteristic. They show how his view of the facts comes into conflict with his original opinions and how he advances through the 'manure' of these contradictions with the aid of very bold idealist constructs and ends up with greatly enriched knowledge. He locates the fundamental contradiction of the German constitutwn m the fact that it is not based on constitutional law at all, but on private law. This view still owes a lot to old-fashioned views of the state which are founded partly on natural law and partly on his view of Greece and Rome. Hence, he finds fault with the principles of German public law because their 'principles are not derived from concepts based on reason', but are merely 'abstractions of reality'. Thus Hegel is able to see how legal codes have arisen in the course of actual social conflicts and he acknowledges this fact where he finds it, but regards it as hostile to reason and as something in contradiction with reality as it should be.18

His position here is strongly idealistic and metaphysical and this becomes even dearer when we consider his explanation of the origins of these 'abstractions ofreality'. In the course of his critical account of this aspect of German history he argues:

'For possession came earlier than law and did not spring from law; on the contrary, whatever was taken by force was made into legal right.'

When we follow his concrete analyses further we find that his objections to the foundations of the Empire in private law are connected with the fact that in the social conflict which effected the transition from the Middle Ages to the modern world the victors in Germany were the forces offeudalism.

'The function of the state was always just to confirm what was taken from its control . . . in Germany the individual member of the body politic owes his power in the state, his rights and his duties to his family, his estate or his guild."

It is evident that in Hegel's eyes the victory of feudal principles are sufficient to explain why Germany has ceased to be a state. And he goes on to show that these public laws founded on private rights have an internal tendency to make themselves autonomous, to emancipate themselves from the state and the nation as a whole and that this leads to a chaos of conflicting nghts and claims. Of course, law now appears to Hegel, even more now than later, not as the product but as the supreme principle of society and the state. But within the framework of this idealist distortion of reality he provides a vivid satirical picture of the situation in Germany where a single system gives one man as much right to resolve matters of war and peace for the entire nation as it gives another to possess so and so many fields or vineyards.^

These passages where he so sharply condemns German conditions give a much clearer illustration of the more historical attitude towards positivity, obsolescence and the need for reform than we had seen m the Wiirttemberg article. He gives an extremely vivid picture of the once progressive forces that had been effective in the past and had indeed built up the imposing edifice of German Empire, and he also gives eloquent expression to the sense oftradition and loyalty that Germans feel for their past. But, on the other hand, he shows quite uncompromisingly that this entire historical structure is utterly divorced from the problems of the present and that, as he had formulated it in the Wiirttemberg pamphlet, the spirit had flown from it.

'The building of the German constitution is the work of past centuries; it is not upheld by the life of the present; the entire fate of more than one century is imprinted in its forms and the justice and violence, courage and cowardice, the honour, the blood, the misery and the well-being of times long since dead and generations long since mouldering, still live on in it. The life and the forces whose development and activity are the pride of the generation now living have no share in it, no interest in it and derive no nourishment from it. This building with its pillars and archaic ornaments stands isolated from the spirit of the age. '2j

Hegel does not use the word positivity here but this analysis undoubtedly contains an historical elaboration ofpositivity.

Of particular significance for the development of his philosophy of history is the section where he deals with the 'saga of German freedom'. For the first time he presents an account of a primitive, stateless society, the kind of society that he later called the 'heroic age'. Later on, of course, it was the development of antiquity before the founding of the state that was so crucial for his thought, but there is also evidence to suggest (e.g. in the Aesthetics) that he thought of the end of the Middle Ages as such a period, as the Vico-like recurrence of such a period. The present discussion is very characteristic of his developing dialectical sense of history. For his position here is just as far from a glorification of primitive societies, and from any desire to return to them, as it is from any vulgar materialist contempt for them, from any temptation to look down on them condescendingly from the 'height of the latest achievements' of civilization. He gives an interesting picture of the so-called age of German freedom, ofa society

'in which ethical customs rather than laws transform a mass into a people and where equal interest rather than a universal command constitutes the state.'

And he concludes his discussion with the following general remarks: 
Just as it is cowardly and effete to describe the men of that society as loathsome, wretched and stupid, and to imagme ourselves to be infi-

mtely more human, happy and clever, so too it is childish and silly to yearn for such a society——as if it alone were natural——or to fail to recogmze that a society ruled by law is necessary——and that it alone is

free. '2 A few years later, in the theses of his dissertation m Jena, Hegel expresses the same idea in a much more pithy, paradoxical way. Talkmg about Hobbes, and to some extent polemicizing against him, he wntcs:

'The state of nature is not unjust, and that is why man must emerge from it. '23

The other fragment deals with these questions in a more general philosophical manner. Rosenkranz who first published it goes so far as to call it a synthesis of Hegel's thoughts about the world crisis.24

Its starting-point and general mood arc already familiar to us from Part II, Chapter i. Following the descnption of the individual who finds himself in a state of crisis Hegel goes on to discuss the world-situation which he summarizes as follows:

'All the manifestations ofthe age show that the old life no longer provides satisfaction; in that life man was limited to the ordered control ofhis possessions, the contemplative enjoyment ofhis utterly subordinate little world, and then, to reconcile him to these limitations, selfdestruction and elevation into heaven.'

The age has put an end to this philistme, religious complacency. Both impovenshment and luxury have abolished the old state of affans. On the one hand, we see the pursmt of wealth, 'the bad conscience to turn one's property, things, into an absolute', and on the other hand, 'the spint of a better life ... has entered the age'. Hegel refers explicitly here to the French Revolution (and he may also have Napoleon in mind) and he also points to the great achievements of German literature and philosophy.

'Its onward impetus is fed by the deeds of individuals ofgreat character, by the movements of entire peoples and by the depiction ofnature and fate in the works ofthe poets; while metaphysics sets limits to the restrictions of existence and gives them their necessity in the context ofthe whole.'25

Hegel's notion of positivity is enriched here by a new element. The idea first became historicized——as we saw in the pamphlet on Wiirttemberg——when he argued that institutions that had once corresponded to the customs of the people in the course of time became divorced from their life and turned into positive mstituuons. Now he suggests that a new spirit may begin to stir amidst the old, inflexible, positive life, and the livmg antagonism and contrast between the old and the new makes things that have been historically superseded into 'positive' phenomena.

How does Hegel imagine that change can be introduced into the crumbling Empire? He gives a brief, very general, philosophical statement, which for that very reason is more radical and politically concrete than elsewhere.

'Life which is full of limitations is a power which can only be overcome by something better if it too becomes a power. ... Only as a particular against a particular can nature function in its actual life as an attack or refutation of the worse form oflife. . . . '25

Hegel's realistic grasp of social conflict is undeniable here when he sees it as the struggle of one power against another (one particular against another). He is in no danger of embracing liberal illusions about 'the irresistible power of ideas' before which the fortresses of absolutism will crumble like the walls ofJericho at the soundofJoshua's trumpets. At the same time, he views the struggle against absolutism and the vestiges of feudalism in the same way as the ideological protagonists of the revolutionary bourgeoisie. Hence when he comes to concretize his attack on this calcified society he writes:

'This society does not base its rule on the power of particular against particular, but on its universality. The truth, the right that it claims for itself must be taken from it and given to those elements of the life that is required. . . . The positive aspects of the existing order, which is a negation of nature, should be left in possession of their truth: that right must exist. 'TI

When these very abstract and somewhat obscure statements are translated onto a philosophical plane they are seen to maintain the general polemic ofthe bourgeois revolutionary class against the old feudal order. They question the retensions ofthe ruling classes, offeudalism, to be the representatives an J leaders of society as a whole, and dismiss these claims as the arrogance ofa small minority, ofparticular interest groups. On the other hand, Hegel does not see the demands of the 'third estate' as the demands of one class vis-a-vis other classes; what he sees is the hitherto suppressed rights of the universal interest, the interests of society as a whole. Thus in the shift to the plane of the universal and the particular, the unmasking of the pretensions of a particular (feudal, absolutist) class to umversality, and the converse elevation of the particular demands of the bourgeois class into a universality sanctioned by nature and history, Hegel is simply providing an abstract philosophical statement of the ideas which, without any philosophical ambitions, formed the essential stock-in-trade of progressive writers before and during the French Revolution. And once again it is of great interest for his development as a thinker that the very first appearance of the dialectic of the umversal and particular should occur not in an abstract philosophical context but in an effort to clarify his thoughts about the real historical dialectics of the destruction offeudalism by the bourgeoisie both for himself and for others.

Hegel's further discussions show even more clearly how the philosophical approach sprang from political and histoncal problems. Immediately after the last passage quoted he goes on to say:

'In the German Empire a universal source of rights has ceased to exist, since it has isolated itself and turned itself into a particular. Hence universality exists now only as an idea and not as reality.'2l

This latter idea provides further confirmation that Hegel's enemy here was the still surviving feudal, absolutist order. From the point of view of his philosophical development we must remind ourselves of those extracts from the Nohl fragments in which he attempted to find a new definition of positivity (see pp. 125—7 supra). We showed there that Hegel's new distinction between the positive and the non-positive was that while both were unions, syntheses, the positive was only an idea, a thought, while the non-positive was a bemg.

Let us remind ourselves further that connected with this distinction was Hegel's first attempt to distinguish between different levels of existence. His statements about this were extremely abstract and obscure. In the present, more historical discussion, however, they become much more concrete. The levels of existence, of existence which is more or less real, are linked to the historical question of the death or collapse of old social formations and the growth of new societies. And this brings us very close to the historical dialectic given by Engels:

'And so, in the course of development, all that was previously real becomes unreal, loses its necessity, its right of existence, its rationality. And in the place of moribund reality comes a new, viable reality . . . '29

Needless to say, Hegel is still far removed from that historical concreteness that he will achieve later in the Philosophy of History. What interests us here is to see how in these fragments he takes the first steps towards developing the dialectical method. It is typical ofthe state of his thought at the time that the fragment breaks off at the point where concrete conclusions had to be drawn from premises that were bold and progressive both philosophically and politically.

1 Rosenkranz, p. 91. The carelessness with which Hegel's literary remains have been treated is very much in evidence here. Rosenkranz says that only a few fragments had survived. But Haym, op. cit., p. 489, claims that he hadseen the whole pamphlet and m fact in his book on Hegel he includes some quotations missmg from Rosenkranz and refers to a number of more or less important arguments without quoting Hegel verbatim. In the meantime, however, the manuscript has again vanished.

15 The two fragments ofHegel's pamphlet on the constitution that we shall examine were probably written late in 1798 and early 1799. At least Rosenzweig, Vol. I, p. 88£ and Hoffmeister, p. 468 have made a convincing case for this date in the case of the first fragment. They have shown that where Hegel mentions the Congress ofRastatt the word 'become' has been crossed out and replaced by 'became', written in a different ink, i.e. the manuscript was presumably written at the time of the Congress but was taken up again and altered, probably when Hegel was revising the entire article inJena. There is disagreement about the dating of the second manuscript fragment among those scholars who were able to examine the original. Haer-ing, pp. 595 and 785, argues that it was written in Jena, i.e. he regards it as contemporaneous with the later version of the whole article. But Rosenzweig, Vol. I, pp. 92压 and 235, and Hoffmeister, p. 469(, both believe it to have been written in Frankfurt. Rosenzweig and Hoffmeister base their conclusions on purely philological arguments connected with the change in Hegel's handwriting, whereas Haering's view is founded on so-called 'internal evidence'.

This fact alone must incline one to accept the first view and this is strengthened by a consideration ofHaering's internal evidence. The method and structure of the second fragment have the typical features of the Frankfurt period: they start from individual experiences and proceed from there to general historical and philosophical statements. This subjective approach is generally abandoned after he leaves Frankfurt. The reader can judge the mood, the intellectual atmosphere of the fragment from the extract from the mtroduction which we quoted in Chapter I (p. 102). That we should favour the date given above rests on the belief that, as the reader will see, it contains similar ideas to the article on Wiirttemberg, but at a higher level of philosophical generalization, i.e. it was obviously written later. A further point is that in February 1799 Hegel commenced his study of economics and this fragment contains scarcely a trace of economic arguments. In all probability, then, it was written before Hegel read Steuart's economics. Of course, these comments are merely hypothetical, but given the present state of Hegel's literary remains we cannot dispense with hypotheses if our aim is to reconstruct the course ofhis development.
