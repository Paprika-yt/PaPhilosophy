NOTEBOOK 6 (1930-32)

DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT

A ruled school notebook (14.7 x 19.8 cm) with hard black covers and a gray spine. A label on the front cover carries the imprint of the stationer: "Gius. Laterza e figli, Bari." Inside the blank space of the label, Gramsci's prison number (“7047〃)is written in black pencil. After Gramsci's death, Tatiana Schucht glued another label on the upper right-hand corner of the front cover； on it, she wrote: “Completo da pg. 1 a 79. VIII〃 (Complete from p. 1 to 79. VIII). The roman numerals indicate the number Schucht assigned to the notebook according to the cataloging system she had devised when organizing Gramsci's papers soon after his death. This notebook has the same external characteristics as Notebooks 3 and 5.

The notebook consists of seventy-eight leaves with twenty-one lines on each side and unlined endpapers in front and back. The recto side of the front endpaper is stamped with the prison seal and with the seal of the prison warden. A signature directly underneath the latter is indecipherable； it is identical to the signature on the front endpaper of Notebook 5 and probably belongs to one of the warden's substitutes. The recto side of each leaf is numbered (1-78) in black ink and stamped with the prison seal: "Casa penale speciale di Turi,, (Special prison of Turi). Gramsci wrote on both sides of the lined leaves and filled them entirely with his notes, except for the last five lines of p. y8r and all of 78V, which are blank. This notebook thus contains 155 manuscript pages. In addition, Gramsci

jotted down the following three bibliographical entries on the recto of the back endpaper:

prof. Bettanini, Lo stile diplomatico, Soc. ed. "Vita e Pensiero/7 Milan, 1930.

Paul Einzig, Behind ths Scenes of International Finance, London, Macmillan, 1931.

Richard Lewinsohn, L'argent dans la Politique, N. Revue Franqaise.

Fr. 24.

In all, the notebook comprises 211 notes, or sections. Of these,

25 are crossed out but remain perfectly legible, and Gramsci later incorporated them into other notebooks； following Valentino Gerratana's denomination, these are called A texts. The other 186 notes, called B texts, were neither crossed out nor used again in other notebooks.

Most of the notes on miscellaneous topics in this notebook are based on Gramsci's more or less systematic review of publications he received in prison, some before he started this notebook and others during the same period when he was making entries in it. It appears that Gramsci started writing this notebook sometime in November or December 1930 and completed it by the end of January 1932. In §9, Gramsci cites the Nuova Italia issue of November 20, 1930, and, in the next notez he refers to the same date's issue of La critica. (These two notes are on pp. ir and 2v of the manuscript.) About one-third of the way into the notebook, Gramsci starts reviewing some materials published in 1931: in §76 (p. 30V in the manuscript), his source of information is an article published in Nuova antologia on March i, 1931； and, in §78 (p. 33t), he refers to La nuova Italia of January 30, 1931. When writing §89 (pp. 4ir-41 v), he seems to have had in front of him the Nuova rivista storica of May-August 1931, while, in §113 (p. 49V), one of his sources of information appears to be Nuova rivista storica of September-December 1931. In §179 (pp. 68v-6$)r) and in §181 (p. 69V), Gramsci alludes to articles published in the Corriere della sera of November

26 and December i, 1931. A parenthetical remark in §197 (p. 74t) reveals that it was written in 1931. Toward the very end of the notebook, in §206 through §208 (pp. yóv-ySr), Gramsci comments on articles that appeared in the Corriere della sera on January 7 and January 8, 1932.

In Uofficina gramsciana: Ipotesi sulla struttura dei nQuad-erni del career(Naples: Bibliopolis, 1984), pp. 141-42, Gianni Francioni offers the following chronology of the composition of Notebook 6:

§§   1-11： between November and December 1930

12-40: December 1930

41-74: between December 1930 and March 13, 1931

75-76: March 1931

77-136: between March and August 1931

137-142: August 1931

143-157: October 1931

158-163: between October and November 1931

164-172: November 1931

173: between November and December 1931

174-202: December 1931

203-205: between December 1931 and January 1932

NOTES TO THE TEXT

§1. Risorgimento. The events of February 1853 and the moderates of Milan
1. Luca Beltrami, "Rievocazioni delPOttocento. Francesco Brioschi” (Recalling the nineteenth century. Francesco Brioschi), Il marzocco 35, no. 14 (April 6, 193。"

On Luca Beltrami, see Notebook 1, §24, n. 2.

2. Francesco Brioschi (1824-97), a mathematician and engineer, was also very active in politics. He had been a professor at the University of Pavia for over a decade when he was first elected to parliament in 1861. Brioschi served as secretary general for public education and was made senator in 1865. In 1863 he helped establish the polytechnic institute of Milan, which he administered for the rest of his life. His stature as an intellectual was confirmed in 1865 when he was elected president of the Lincei Academy.

3. Gramsci discusses the obsequiousness of the Milanese moderates during a period of harsh repression (including the execution of Mazzinian revolutionaries at Belfiore) by the Austrians in Notebook 1, §43, and Notebook 3/ §125. See also the corresponding notes to the text: Notebook 1, §43, n. 24； and Notebook 3, §125, n. 1.

§2. Father Bresciani"s progeny. Giulio Bechi
1. Gramsci expresses his views on Giulio Bechi and his book on Sardinia, Caccia grossa, in Notebook i； §50； see also n. 6 there.

2. Mario Puccioni, "Militarismo ed italianità negli scritti di Giulio Bechi” (Militarism and the Italian spirit in the writings of Giulio Bechi), Il marzocco 35, no. 38 (July 13, 1930). Puccioni alludes to an article on Bechi by Guido Biagi published in II marzocco in 1917 and to Ermenegildo Pistelli's book of biographical sketches, Profili e caratteri (Florence, 1921).

Mario Puccioni (1887-1940), a lawyer from Tuscany, was best known for his numerous books and articles on the history of the Risorgimento (a couple of which Gramsci cites in other notes), including some editions of source materials related to the national unification movement. He also had a keen interest in nature and hunting, to which he devoted a short book of memoirs, Cacce e cacciatori di Toscana (Turin: Vallecchi, 1934). Puccioni was an active member of the cultural circle associated with the periodical II Leonardo.

Guido Biagi (1855-1925) was born and died in Florence, where for twenty-eight years he was the director of the Medici library, A founding member of the Italian Bibliographical Society, as well as a member and librarian of the Crusca Academy, he also served as the director of the literary division of the publisher Sansoni.

On Ermenegildo Pistelli, see Notebook 3』§109, n. 5.

§3. Encyclopedic notions. Cleopatra's nose
i. Gramsci is referring to the following segment |no. 162 in most editions) in Blaise Pascal's Pensées (1670): /zWhoever wants to gain a thorough understanding of human vanity needs only to consider the causes and effects of love. The cause is a je ne sais quoi (Corneille)； and the effects are frightful. This je ne sais quoi, an element so minute that it cannot be identified, stirs up a whole country, princes, armies, the entire world. Cleopatra's nose: had it been shorter, the whole face of the earth would have changed."

There are several dependable English translations of Pascal's work； see, for example, Pensées, trans. A. J. Krailsheimer (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966).

§4. Popular literature
i. This biographical work by the German writer Oskar Maria Graf (1894-1967), Wir sind Gefangene (Munich: Drei Masken, 1927), was translated into French under the title Nous sommes pi;isonniers (Paris: Gal-limard, 1930). Gramsci, most probably, learned about the French edition of Graf's book from a short review of it (signed Ph. Neel) in Les nouvelles littéraires 9, no. 421 (November 8, 1930).

§5. Popular literature. Serial novels
1. The bibliographical data on Henry Jagot's book and the other information in this note on the legendary (and, in the eyes of many, notorious) French detective Fran?ois-Eugène Vidocq (1775-1857) are extracted from an article by Georges Mongredien, "Vidocq，' Les nouvelles littéraires 9, no. 422 (November 15, 1930). Marx alludes in passing to Vidocq's memoirs in chapter 5 of The Holy Family.

2. Vautrin appears in several of Honoré de Balzac's novels, including Le pére Goriot (1834)； Balzac also wrote a play entitled Vautrin (1840). Jean Valjean is the central character in Victor Hugo's Les miserables (1862). Rocambole was the fictional creation of the nineteenth-century French serial novelist Pierre-Alexis Ponson du Terra il, whom Gramsci mentioned several times in his notes on popular literature.

3. There exist several versions and editions of the Mémoires attributed to Frangoise-Eugène Vidocq, some of which were published during his lifetime. The full title of one such edition provides a good indication of the general nature of the contents: Vie et aventmes de Vidocq, ancien chef de la police de Sùreté: Sa naissance, son éducation, ses services militaires, ses desertions, ses divers emprisonnements et condamnations, ses evasions des bagnes et des prisons, ses amours, son manage, ses duels, ses déguisements, ses dénonciations, ses découvertes importantes, ses relations avec la police, les air estations qu'il a faites, etc, (Paris, 1830). For an English version, see Vidocq: The Personal Memoirs of the First Great Detective, ed. and trans. Edwin Gilè Rich (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1935).

§6. Risorgimento. Italy in the eighteenth century
I. See the article (signed 〃Z〃)"Studi su Italia e Francia nel Settecento” (Studies on Italy and France in the eighteenth centuryin the ^Biblioteca di cultura” (Cultural library) section of II marzocco 35, no. 20 (May 18, 1930), which is Gramsci's source of information on Henri Bédarida's book, Parme dans la politique franQaise au XVIIIe siede (Paris: Alcan, 1930), and on Giuseppe Ortolani's study, "Italie e France au XVIIIe siècle," in Melanges de littérature et df hi sto ir e publiés par lf Union intellectuelle franco-italienne (Paris: Leroux, 1929). This same article by "Z" also cites an article by Antonio Panella, "Parma e la Francia nella seconda metà del secolo XVIH〃 (Parma and France in the second half of the eighteenth century), Il marzocco 33/ no. 20 (May 13, 1928), that refers to the "two earlier works" by Henri Bédarida: Parme et la France de 1748 a 1789 (Paris: Champion, 1928), and Les premiers Bourbons de Parme et l'E Spagne: 1731-1802 (Paris: Champion, 1928).

§8. The Italian Risorgimento. The Parthenopean Republic

1. Gramsci's source of information on Antonio Manes's book about the military exploits of Cardinal Ruffo is the article (signed 〃Z"* “Studi su Italia e Francia nel Settecento” (Studies on Italy and France in the eighteenth century], in the "Biblioteca di cultura” (Cultural library) section of Il marzocco 35, no. 20 (May 18, 1930).

2. On Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo's role in overthrowing the Parthenopean Republic and restoring the Bourbon monarchy in Naples, see Notebook i, §43, n. 6.

3. See Notebook 2, §62, which, however, is not entitled "Past and present^ but "Joseph De Maistre" and does not refer to the "polemics" against Settembrini, although it does comment on the effort to rehabilitate Solaro della Margarita through the republication of his Memorandum storicopolitico.

On Count Clemente Solaro della Margarita, see Notebook 2, §62, n. 4.

Luigi Settembrini [1813-76) was very active from an early stage in the antimonarchical republican movement in Naples. In 1847 he publicly attacked the Bourbon government in a political pamphlet, Protesta del popolo delle Due Sicilie (Protest from the people of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies). A founding member of the secret society Unità Italiana, he was arrested and imprisoned after the collapse of the 1848 revolution. At the end of a long trial, he received a death sentence that, however, was commuted to life imprisonment. In 1859 he was released on condition that he emigrate to America, but during a stop in Ireland he managed to disembark from the ship in which he was being deported and made his way to Turin instead. Settembrini returned to Naples in 1861, as a university professor of Italian literature. He was named senator in 1873. His best-known works are Lezioni di letteratura italiana (Lectures on Italian literature) and the unfinished memoirs Ricordanze della mia vita.

4. The Sanfedisti were the bands of armed peasants organized by Cardinal Ruffo as his "Army of the Holy Faith. 〃

5. These allusions to Niccolò Rodolico's writings are drawn from the article (signed 〃Z"), “Studi su Italia e Francia nel Settecento,^

Gramsci also cites Niccolò Rodolico's book on the people's role during the early stages of the Risorgimento movement in southern Italy一II popolo agli inizi del Risorgimento nellfItalia meridionale [Florence: Le Monnier, 1925I一in Notebook 3, §107.

On Niccolò Rodolico, see Notebook 1, §62, n. 1.

§9- Father Bresciani"s progeny, Lina Pietravalle
1. Lina Pietravalle^ novel. Le catene (The chains), was reviewed by Giulio Marzot in La nuova Italia i, no. n (November 20, 1930): 464-65.

Lina Pietravalle (1890-1956) wrote novels and short stories portraying peasants and their ways of life in the Molise region. She also wove elements of the local dialects into her narratives. Pietravalle^ depiction of the ostensibly primordial passions of her rural characters bears some superficial resemblances to certain features commonly associated with verismo, the Italian novelistic tradition of which Verga was the major exponent.

Giulio Marzot (1901-75), a literary critic and professor of Italian literature at the University of Bologna, wrote for various important literary journals, including Belfagor and Nuova antologia. Two of his books and many of his essays deal with Verga and the verismo movement.

2. See Giulio Marzot, L'arte del Verga: Note ed analisi (Verga's art: Notes and analyses), published by the Istituto Magisteriale of Vicenza in 1930.

On Giovanni Verga, see Notebook i, §43/ n. 28.

3. Carl Hagenbeck, Von Tieren und Menschen: Erlebnisse und Erfahrungen (Berlin: Vita, 1908). Gramsci had probably come across this book many years before his imprisonment, which would explain why he mistakenly remembers its title as being Io e- le belve- (The beasts and I). Hagenbeck's autobiographical account of his experiences as an animal tamer and merchant was translated into Italian as Le mie memorie di domatore e mercante (Milan: Quintini, 1910). For an abridged English version of this work, see Beasts and Men, trans. Hugh S. Elliot and A. G. Thacker (London: Longmans, Green, 1909).

Carl Hagenbeck (1844-1913) was an internationally famous animal trainer and trader. He traveled widely with his collection of wild animals, publicly displaying his techniques of befriending and controlling them. He is credited with pioneering the idea of putting animals on display in openair zoos rather than cages.

§10. Past and present
i. Otto WestphaFs Feinde Bismarcks: Geistige Grundlagen der deut-chen Opposition, 1848-1918 (Munich: R. Oldenbourg, 1930) was reviewed by Benedetto Croce in La critica 28/ no. 6 (November 20, 1930): 453-54. Taking his cue from the opening chapter (〃Der Fall 'Emil Ludwig"') of WestphaFs book, Croce makes some deprecatory remarks about the kind of popular treatment of history exemplified by the very successful works of the German writer Emil Ludwig. Croce belittles such works and labels them ^bellettristica storica” (historical belles-lettres or bellettristic history)—in other words, dilettantish as opposed to being professional, scholarly historiography.

Emil Ludwig (1881-1948), who started his career as a foreign correspondent for a German newspaper during World War I, achieved international success with his numerous historical-biographical works that appealed to a large, popular readership in several countries. Many of Ludwig's works were translated into English, including his novel Diana (1929) and his biographies of Napoleon, Bismarck； Kaiser Wilhelm II, Goethe, Christ, Lincoln, Cleopatra, Roosevelt, and Beethoven. His interviews with Mussolini were published in several languages, including English: Talks with Mussolini, trans. E. Paul and C. Paul (Boston: Little, Brown, 1933). Gramsci owned a copy of the French translation of Ludwig's biography of Wilhelm II； see Notebook i, §117/ n. 1.

2. Croce published the text of "Antistoricismo” (Antihistoricism), which he wrote for the Philosophy Congress held at Oxford in 1930, in La critica 28/ no. 6 (November 20, 1930):401-9—-that is, in the same issue as his review of WestphaFs book that Gramsci cites at the beginning of this note. "Antistoricismo" was also published in a book, together with another text on modern philosophy that Croce wrote for the Congress of Philosophy held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1926； see B. Croce, Punti di orientamento della filosofia moderna: Antistoricismo (Bari: Laterza, 1930), of which Gramsci had a copy.

3. A central aspect of Giovanni Gentile's philosophy of actualism was the identification of history with philosophy, together with the notion that actual thinking creates being. For Gentile's philosophy of "actual ide-alism/〃 see, inter alia, his systematic exposition in Teoria generale dello spirito come atto puro (Pisa: Mariotti, 1916), translated into English as The Theory of Mind as Pure Act, trans, and intro. H. Wildon Carr (London: Macmillan, 1922).

4. See Luigi Einaudi, "Se esista, storicamente, la pretesa ripugnanza degli economisti verso il concetto dello Stato produttore: Lettera aperta a R. Benini" (Does it exist, historically, the supposed repugnance of economists toward the concept of state as producer: An open letter to R. Benini), Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 3, no. 5 (September-October 1930): 302—14. This article is followed (in the same issue of Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica) by a response from Rodolfo Benini, ^Coesione e solidarietà” (Cohesiveness and solidarity, pp. 315-20)； and by Ugo Spirito^ article "La storia della economia e il concetto di Stato” (The history of economics and the concept of State, pp. 321-24).

3. Gramsci refers to this opinion of Maurras's in Notebook 5, §144.

§13. The medieval communes as an economic-corporative phase of modern development
1. Bernardino Barbadoro怎 tome on the finances (and specifically on the system of direct taxation and the public debt) of the Florentine Republic, Le finanze della Repubblica fiorentina: Imposta diretta e debito pubblico fino all1 istituzione del Monte (Florence: Olschki. 1929), was reviewed by Antonio Panella in Pègaso 2, no. 7 (July 1930): 110-12. Panella's review is the source of the bibliographical data and all the other information on Barbadorozs work contained in this note.

Antonio Panella (1878-1954), an administrator of archives with a historicist orientation, spent almost his entire career in Florence, where he also conducted important research on primary sources pertaining to the history of Florence and of the Medicis. His noteworthy work on Machiavelli includes an edition of Machiavelli's complete works (published by Rizzoli of Milan in 1939) and Gli antimachiavellici (Florence: Sansoni, 1943).

2. Giuseppe Canestrini (1807-70) produced a large body of work on various aspects of medieval and early Renaissance Italian history, as well as on the Risorgimento. The volume to which Gramsci alludes here is La scienza e Parte di Stato: Desunta dagli atti ufficiali della Repubblica fiorentina e dei Medici. Ordinamenti economici一della finanza (Florence: Le Monnier, 1862)； it is a study of official documents relating to the taxation of real estate and personal property in Florence during the republican period and under the Medicis.

3. Two of the works by the German historian Heinrich Sieveking (18711946) that deal directly with finance, banking, and accounting in Genoa between the thirteenth and the fifteenth century are Aus genueser Re-chnungs- und Steuerbüchern: Ein Beitrag zur mittel al terlichen Handelsund Vermogensstatistik (Vienna: Im Kommission bei A. Holder, 1909)； and Genueser Finanzwesen mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Casa di

S. Giorgio, 2 vols. (Freiburg i. B.: J. C.B. Mohr, 1898-99).

4. A professor at the Venice Institute for Advanced Studies in Economics and Commerce, Fabio Besta (1845-1923) was best known for his work on accountancy, but he also conducted some historical research on Venetian finance.

Roberto Cessi (1885-1969) published numerous books on the history of Venice, including a collection of essays on the politics and economics of fourteenth-century Venice, Politica ed economia di Venezia nel trecento (Rome: Storia e Letteratura； 1952), and an edition of documents on monetary policies in the Venetian Republic during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Problemi monetari veneziani (Padua: Milani, 1937).

Among the many volumes that Gino Luzzatto (1878-1964) wrote on the economic history of Italy from antiquity to the modern era, three are devoted entirely to Venice: one is an economic history of Venice between the eleventh and the sixteenth century. Storia economica di Venezia dalPXI al XVI secolo (Venice: Centro Internazionale delle Arti e del Costume, 1961)； another is on the public debt of the Venetian Republic from the twelfth century to the end of the fifteenth, Il debito pubblico della Repubblica di Venezia dagli ultimi decenni del XII secolo alla fine del XVf 2d ed. (Milan: Istituto Editoriale Cisalpino, 1963)； and the third is a collection of essays on Venetian economic history, Studi di storia economica veneziana (Padua: Milani, 1954).

5. The term "Monte" referred to the total amount (the "heap" or "mountain") of debt incurred by a government； the use of the term in this sense first emerged in the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice. As an institution, the Monte was something between a treasury and a bank: it kept an account of the amounts of money borrowed by the government and it made interest payments to the creditors.

Walter de Brienne, titular duke of Athens, governed Florence for brief periods on two separate occasions. In 1325-1326/ the Florentines were in serious danger of being overwhelmed by their Ghibelline enemies, andz as a protective measure, they conferred sovereignty over their city on Charles, the duke of Calabria, son of the king of Naples, Robert of Anjou. However, as Machiavelli explains in chapter 6 of his History of Florence, /zCharles, being engaged in the wars of Sicily and therefore unable to undertake the sovereignty of the city, sent in his stead Walter, by birth a Frenchman and duke of Athens. He, as viceroy, took possession of the city." In July 1326/ Charles himself entered the city； his authoritarian rule and the enormous amounts of money he extracted from the Florentines rendered him most unpopular. His death was a cause for celebration. For over a decade afterward, Florence prospered in an atmosphere of relative tranquility. In 1340, however, it started to experience serious difficulties again. Strife among the various factions, a very severe financial crisis (including the collapse of the Bardi and Peruzzi banks in 1342, caused in large measure by the king of England, Edward III, defaulting on his debts), and the failure of a crucial effort to acquire dominion over the city of Lucca brought the city to the brink of disaster. As they had done before, the Florentines turned to the king of Naples for help, and Robert of Anjou sent them Walter de Brienne, duke of Athens. Walter had himself proclaimed prince of Florence for life, but his despotic rule quickly became intolerable, and after a year in office he was driven out of the city.

On the "signoria" see Notebook 5, §123, n. 9.

6. Marx discusses the importance of public一that isz national一debt in chapter 31 ("The Genesis of the Industrialist Capitalist^) of book 1 of Capital. Among other things, he writes:

The system of public credit, i.e. of national debts, the origins of which are to be found in Genoa and Venice as early as the Middle Ages, took possession of Europe as a whole during the period of manufacture. The colonial system, with its maritime trade and its commercial wars, served as a forcing house for the credit system, Thus it first took root in Holland. The national debt, i.e. the alienation of the state一whether the state is despotic, constitutional or republican一marked the capitalist era with its stamp.

The public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation. As with the stroke of an enchanter's wandz it endows unproductive money with the power of creation and thus turns it into capital, without forcing it to expose itself to the troubles and risks inseparable from its employment in industry or even in usury. The state's creditors actually give nothing away, for the sum lent is transformed into public bonds, easily negotiable, which go on functioning in their hands just as so much hard cash would. (Karl Marx, Capital, trans. Ben Fowkes [New York: Penguin, 1990], 1:919)

§14. The international function of Italian intellectuals. Monsignor Della Casa
i. See the second part of Benedetto Croce's study "La lirica del Cinquecento" (The fifteenth -century lyric) in La crìtica 28, no. 6 (November 20, 1930): 410-29.

Galateo, a treatise on etiquette and polite conversation, is named in honor of Galeazzo (Galatheus) Florimonte, bishop of Sessa, who prompted Giovanni Della Casa (1503-56) to write it. Della Casa, who was named bishop of Benevento and served as papal nuncio in Venice, had a successful ecclesiastical career that culminated in his appointment as secretary of state by Pope Paul IV. A worldly man given to sensual pleasures, Della Casa also produced a diverse body of writing, including a volume of lyrical poetry, Rime, and political works, such as the Orazioni politiche (Political discourses) and, in Latin, De officiis inter potentiores et tenuiores amicos. The latter work was translated into English in the seventeenth century； see The Aits of Grandeur and Submission； oif A discourse concerning the behaviour of great men towards their inferiors, and of inferior personages towards men of greater quality, trans. Henry Stubbe, id ed. (London: William Lee, 1670). It was, however, Galateo that brought Della Casa widespread renown. Written between 1550 and 1555, it was published in 1558 and first translated into English by Robert Peterson in 1576. For a modern English translation, see Galateo: A Renaissance Treatise on Manners, 3d ed., rev., ed., and trans. Konrad Eisenbichler and Kenneth R. Bartlett (Toronto: Center for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 1994).

2. See Gramsci's remarks on Alberti and Castiglione in Notebook 5, §55 and §91, and the corresponding Notes to the Text.

3. Gramsci is quoting Benedetto Croce's description of De officiis in 〃La lirica del Cinquecento,p. 414.

§15. Encyclopedic notions
i. Ugo Bernasconi, "Parole alla buona gente” (Words for respectable people), Pègaso 2, no. 8 (August 1930): 186-94. The two aphorisms quoted by Gramsci appear on p. 188 and p. 190； respectively.

Ugo Bernasconi (1874-1960), a painter and illustrator, was also an art critic and a writer of fiction and nonfiction. Furthermore, he translated some of the aphoristic writings of Pascal, Bossuet, and La Rochefoucauld and composed hundreds of aphorisms of his own. A collection of Bernasconi^ aphorisms was published posthumously with some of his illustrations； see Parole alla buona gente, ed. Clelia Martignoni (Pistoia: Niccolai, 1988).

§16. Father Bresciani's progeny, Italian national culture
i. Ugo Ojetti； /zLettera a Umberto Fracchia sulla critica,, (Letter on criticism to Umberto Fracchia), Pègaso i, no. 8 (August 1930): 207-11. This open letter/article by Ojetti is part of a protracted controversy (already mentioned by Gramsci in Notebook 3/ §63) that arose when Umberto Fracchi* in an open letter, 〃A S.E. Volpe77 (To H[is] E[xcellency] Volpe) in L'Italia letteraria 2, no. 25 (June 22, 1930)； criticized a speech given by Gioacchino Volpe in his capacity as secretary of the Italian Academy. Volpe's speech was published as an article, "Il primo anno delFAccademia d'Italia” (The first year of the Italian Academy) in Nuova antologia 65/ no. 1398 (June 16, 1930): 490-96. Gramsci refers again to this speech and the polemic it generated in Notebook 6/ §38； he also quotes a brief extract from Volpe's speech in Notebook 7/ §66. The controversy generated numerous articles in Ultalia letteraria, as well as in other newspapers and periodicals. Ugo Ojetti intervened with his "Lettera a Umberto Fracchia sulla critica,n which is discussed here. Fracchia, in turn, responded to Ojetti with "Ojetti e la critica” (Ojetti and criticism) in L'Italia letteraria 1, no. 32 (August 10, 1930).

§17. Popular literature. The detective novel
1. Aldo Sorani, "Conan Doyle e la fortuna del romanzo poliziesco” (Conan Doyle and the fortunes of the detective novel), Pègaso 2, no. 8 (August 1930): 212-20.

2. Gramsci articulates his views on Chesterton and Arthur Conan Doyle at somewhat greater length in a letter to Tatiana Schucht, October 6,1930:

Chesterton has written a most delicate caricature of detective stories rather than detective stories per se. Father Brown is a Catholic who pokes fun at the mechanical thought processes of the Protestants and the book is basically an apologia of the Roman Catholic Church as against the Anglican Church. Sherlock Holmes is the "Protestant" detective who finds the end of the criminal skein by starting from the outside, relying on science, on experimental method, on induction. Father Brown is the Catholic priest who through the refined psychological experiences offered by confession and by the persistent activity of the priests7 moral casuistry, though not neglecting science and experimentation, but relying especially on deduction and introspection, totally defeats Sherlock Holmes, makes him look like a pretentious little boy, shows up his narrowness and pettiness. Moreover, Chesterton is a great artist while Conan Doyle was a mediocre writer, even though he was knighted for literary merit； thus in Chesterton there is a stylistic gap between the content, the detective story plot, and the form, and therefore a subtle irony with regard to the subject being dealt with, which renders his stories so delicious. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from

Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994L 1:354)

3. Gabriel Gale is the protagonist in the eight stories that make up G.K. Chesterton's The Poet and the Lunatics, originally published in 1929.

4. La morte civile (Civil death), first staged in 1861, was the most successful work of the prolific Italian playwright Paolo Giacometti (1816-82), most of whose eighty some comedies and tragedies betray a very strong French influence. The play is about a man serving a life sentence who manages to escape and discovers that his wife and daughter had been able to rebuild their lives successfully in his absence. Rather than disrupt their happiness, he commits suicide.

The melodrama Les crochets du pére Martin by Eugène Cormon (18101903) and Eugène Grangé (1810-87) was performed for the first time in Paris in 1858. Its popularity spread well beyond France—it was even performed on Broadway in 1907, under the title Papa Martin.

Gramsci attended a performance of La gerla di papà Martino (the Italian title of the play) at the Alfieri theater in Turin and reviewed it in the March 16, 1916, issue of Avanti!. Gramsci's review is full of praise for the actor, Ermete Novelli, who played the role of Martin, and it contains a number of observations that anticipate some of his comments in this note.

§18. Father Bresciani's progeny. The national sentiment of writers
i. Ugo Ojetti, "Lettera a Piero Parini sugli scrittori sedentari” (Letter to Piero Parini on sedentary writers), Pègaso 2, no. 9 (September 1930): 340-42； the quoted passage is on p. 341.

On Ugo Ojetti, see Notebook i, §24, n. 4.

§19. Encyclopedic notions. On truth or on telling the truth in politics
i. Gramsci read this anecdote in an article by Francesco Flora, z/Freud e i motti di spirito(Freud and jokes), Pègaso 2, no. 9 (September 1930): 348一 56； the anecdote is recounted on p. 348. Flora cites as his source a French translation of Sigmund Freud's Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewussten (1905). For an English translation of the original, see The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Fiend, vol. 8, Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, trans. James Strachey (London: Hogarth, 1960^ p. 115.

§20. Problems in linguistics. Giulio Bertoni
i. Giulio Bertoni^ book Linguaggio e poesia (Language and poetry) was reviewed by Natalino Sapegno in Pègaso 1, no. 9 (September 1930)： 368-69.

Natalino Sapegno (1901-90), literary historian and critic, was born in Turin, where, in his formative years, he was a friend of Piero Gobetti. His early work betrays a strong Crocean influence, but after the war his scholarly work had more of a Marxist timbre. A celebrated literary scholar and a member of the Lincei Academy, he would later also write some essays on Gramsci.

See also Gramsci's earlier note on Bertoni, Notebook 3, §74, and the accompanying Notes to the Text.

2. See Notebook 3, §74, n. 6.

3. "Pomo〃 is Italian for 〃apple.〃

Carlo Dossi (1849-1910), a writer with a distinctive, innovative style, a lively sense of humor, and an experimental and often satirical bent, was loosely associated with the nineteenth-century Milanese scapigliatura (bohemianism) movement. Gramsci owned a volume of his selected writings, Opere di Carlo Dossi (Milan: Treves, 1910). The anecdote recounted here is from the second section of the third chapter of Dossi's 1868 ironic (and somewhat autobiographical) narrative on childhood Ualtrieri: Nero su bianco (The day before yesterday: Black on white)； the chapter is entitled "Panche di scuola” (School benches),

i. Domenico Petrini, "Politici e moralisti del Seicento” (Seventeenthcentury politicians and moralists), Pègaso 2, no. 8 (August 1930): 229-36.

Domenico Petrini (1902-31) was a close follower of Croce. Among other things, he published a volume, Note sul barocco (Rieti: Bibliotheca, 1929), that was meant to be a companion to Benedetto Croce's Storia delPetà barocca.

Benedetto Croce's study of the baroque period in Italy, Storia delPetà barocca (Bari: Laterza, 1929), was among the books Gramsci had while in prison at Turi.

2. The text of Pope Pius XFs encyclical of December 23, 1929, Quinquagesimo ante anno (titled, as is customary, after its opening phrase, "Fifty years ago,z), was published under the heading "Sanctissimi domini nostri Pii Divina Providentia Papae XI Litt era e encyclicae. De anno sacerdotii sui quinquagesimo exacto feliciter,/ in La civiltà cattolica 81 (January i8z 1930)： 97-125.

The paragraph from which the brief phrase is quoted reads: "Next』as regards the Concordat which at the same time We agreed to and ratified. As We expressly proclaimed at the time, We now reaffirm and proclaim that it is not to be considered as a sort of guarantee of the treaty by which the so-called Roman Question was ended, but that both一Treaty and Concordat一on account of the identical fundamental principle from which they derive, form one indivisible and inseparable whole, so that either both hold or both perish" [The Papal Encyclicals, ed. C. Carlen [Wilmington, N.C.: McGrath, 1981], p. 346).

§25. Past and present
i. This is a reference to the same encyclical discussed in the previous note (§24).

§26. Father B res ciani"s progeny. Pirandello
1. Between 1916 and 1920 (and therefore not only during the war but after it as well), Gramsci wrote close to two hundred articles in his regular theater column ("Cronache teatrali") in the Turin edition of Avanti! During that period, he reviewed performances of the following plays by Pirandello (followed by date of publication in Avanti!): Pensaci Giacomino! March 24, 1917； Liolà, April 4, 1917； Cosi è (se vi pare), October 5, 1917； Il piacere dell'onestà, November 2, 1917； "A berretta ccu li ciancianeddi, February 27, 1918； Il giuoco delle parti, February 6, 1919； L'innesto, March 29, 1919； La ragione degli altri, January 13, 1920； Come prima, meglio di prima, Aprii 8, 1920； Cecé, December 16, 1920. Six of these reviews一Pensaci Giacomino! Liolàf Cosi è (se vi pare), Il piacere delTonestà, Il giuoco delle parti, and La ragione degli altri一have been translated into English in Antonio Gramsci, Selections from Cultural Writings, ed. D. Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans. W・ Boelhower (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1985): 77-86.

In his letter of March 19, 1927, Gramsci told Tatiana Schucht of his abiding interest in Pirandello and of his wish to write a book about his plays: "A study of Pirandello^ theater and of the transformation of Italian theatrical taste that Pirandello represented and helped to form. Did you know that I discovered and contributed to the popularity of Pirandello^ theater long before Adriano Tilgher? I wrote about Pirandello from 1915 to 1920, enough to put together a book of 200 pages, and at the time my judgments were original and without precedent: Pirandello was either amiably tolerated or openly derided” (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 1:84).

2. Gramsci's own review of Pirandello's L'innesto (which was first staged in Milan in January 1919), though it conveys quite clearly the crux of the plot on which the moral and philosophical interest of the play depends, was not favorable. The concluding paragraph of Gramsci's review is especially harsh: "Each of the three acts is labored； they are dry and dense, and they run on. The theme is set forth, but it is not enlivened； the passion and the folly are presupposed, but they are not represented. Pirandello has not even provided one of his typical dramatic zconversations,7 which may not count for much in the history of art but which have a very important function in the history of Italian culture."

No documents or oral accounts shed light on what Gramsci refers to as "Berrini's offers." Gramsci wrote generally favorable reviews of three plays by Nino Berrini (1880-1962), all of them in his theater column in Avanti!: La signora inamorata, December 5, 1918； Una donna moderna, July 5, 1919； and II beffardo, April 4, 1920. Gramsci also makes some observations on Berrini's formulaic techniques of playwriting in Notebook 14/ §6i.

3. Gramsci's review of Pirandello's Liolàf in the Avanti! of April 4/ 1917, opens with a sardonic comment on its poor reception by the theatergoing public:

The new three-act play by Luigi Pirandello was not a success at the Alfieri [theater in Turin], It did not even meet with that success a play needs to make a profit. In spite of this, though, Liolà remains a fine play, perhaps the best that the Sicilian dialect theater has created. The failure of the third act, which caused the work to be momentarily withdrawn, was due to extrinsic reasons: Liolà does not end in the traditional way, with a knifing or a marriage. Therefore, it was not received enthusiastically. But it could not have ended any other way than it did and therefore it will eventually find favor. (Selections from the Cultural Writings: 79)

Similarly, in another of his theater columns—Avanti! March 29, 1918— Gramsci writes: ^Pirandellos Liolà [is] one of the most beautiful modern plays that the crass pseudomoralizing critics have done almost everything to eliminate from the repertory/7

Gramsci also discusses Pirandello at some length in Notebook 14, §15.

4. "Lazzaro ossia un mito di Luigi Pirandello(Lazarus or a myth of Luigi Pirandello), in the "Rivista della stampa” (Review of the press) section of La civiltà cattolica 81 (April 5,1930): 52-57. This article, ostensibly occasioned by Pirandello's play Lazarus (1929), denounces the playwright as a "master of unbelief and immorality, ruinous to young people who are already being led astray by the materialistic or idealist encroachment of modern art and philosophy.

§27. Father Bresciani^ progeny. Super city and sup er country
i. Massimo Bontempelli, “Il Novecentismo è vivo o è morto?” (Is twen-tieth-centuryism alive or is it dead?), Ultalia letteraria 2, no. 46 (November 16, 1930).

"Novecentismo" in the title of Massimo Bontempelli's open letter refers to the movement associated with the periodical '900 (i.e.. Novecento, which is Italian for "twentieth century") that was founded by Bontempelli and Curzio Malaparte in 1926. For the first two years, the periodical was published in French as Cahiers d‘Italie et d'Europe. The writers, artists, and critics linked to this movement, several of whom had earlier been attracted to futurism, regarded themselves as part of the cosmopolitan avant-garde or modernist movement in the arts that was sweeping Western Europe. Despite their vaunted cosmopolitanism (hence the "Stracittà," or supercity, label), they were nationalist and decidedly fascist. Curzio Malaparte had a falling-out with Bon temp elli very early on, and he quickly established close ties with the weekly II selvaggio, which had been founded by Mino Mac-cari in 1924. No less nationalist or fascist, Maccari and his circle decried what they regarded as the corrupting influence of foreign fashions. Anticosmopolitan and antimodern, they sought to defend and promote Italy's rural character and mores—hence "Strapaese/' or supercountry. BontempellVs open letter, discussed by Gramsci in this note, was just one salvo in a bitter polemic that filled the pages of many cultural publications of the time.

On Massimo Bontempelli, see Notebook 1, §136, n. 1.

Gian Battista Angioletti (1896-1961) was coeditor with Curzio Malaparte of Ultalia letteraria between 1928 and 1931 and continued as sole editor until 1934.

2. L'Italiano, one of the organs of the supercountry movement with which Curzio Malaparte was closely associated for some years, was founded by Leo Longanesi (1905-57) in 1926.

On Curzio Malaparte, see Notebook 1, §9, n. 1.

3. The newspaper II mondo, which had been critical of fascism (and edited for a time by Giovanni Amendola), was suppressed by the regime in 1926.

Corrado Alvaro (1895-1956), novelist and essayist, started his career as a journalist. After working for the Corriere della sera, he became the Paris correspondent for II mondo. His best-known novel, Gente in Aspromonte, was published in 1930.

§28. Popular literature
1. See "I tre moschettieri” (The three musketeers), in the "Rassegna della stampa” (Review of the press) section of Ultalia letteraria 2, no. 45 (November 16, 1930).

On Filippo Burzio, see Notebook 1, §28, n. 3.

2. See Notebook 5, §54. Gramsci touches on the same topic again in Notebook 6, §134.

§29. Father Brescianis progeny
i. “Cose viste” (Things witnessed) was the title of a regular column by Ugo Ojetti in the Corriere della sera. It first appeared in October 1921 and was continued until 1941. In 1923 the columns were collected in a homonymous volume published by Treves of Milan. Other volumes and reeditions followed over the years.

On Ugo Ojetti, see Notebook i, §24, n. 4.

2. Giuseppe Prezzolini, Mi pare . . . (Florence: Delta, 1925), p. i6. Gramsci had a copy of this book in prison.

On Giuseppe Prezzolini, see Notebook i, §8, n. 1.

§30. Encyclopedic notions
i. Uidea nazionale, the mouthpiece of the Italian National Association, started as a weekly in 1911 and became a daily in 1914. In 1926/ three years after the Nationalists merged with the Fascists, Eidea nazionale was absorbed by La tribuna, which like other major newspapers of the time had come under Fascist control.

§31. Past and present
i. Giuseppe Prezzolini, Mi pare . . . (Florence: Delta, 1925), p. 69. Gramsci had a copy of this book in prison.

On Giuseppe Prezzolini, see Notebook 1, §8/ n. 1.

§32. Brief notes on Indian culture
1. Frédéric Lefèvre, "Une heure avec Aldous Huxley/' Les nouvelles lit-téraires 9/ no. 420 (November i, 1930).

A translation of the passage transcribed by Gramsci:

What do you think of the revolts and all that is going on in India?

I believe that civilization has gotten off on the wrong foot there. They have created top universities but no primary schools. They thought it was enough to enlighten one caste that would then be able to elevate the masses, but the results have not been very good, in my view. Only the Kshatris and the Brahmins have benefited from Western civilization. Once they have been educated, they stop working and become dangerous. They are the ones who want to take over the government. As a result of visiting India, I was better able to understand the difference between a villein and a cardinal in the Middle Ages. India is a country where the superiority of divine right is still accepted by the untouchables, who acknowledge their own unworthiness.

2. See Notebook i, §25, n. 13

§33. The intellectuals
i. The series of interviews published in Les nouvelles litter air es was collected in five volumes that appeared under the title Une heure avec ... in the book series "Les documents bleus" published By the Nouvelle revue frangaise (NRF) in Paris. Gramsci learned about these volumes from the "Correspondence" section in Les nouvelles littéraires 9, no. 420 (November I, 1930).

On December 15, 1930, Gramsci wrote to Tatiana Schucht: "The periodicals Pègaso and Les nouvelles littéraires have always arrived regularly, and I do find them interesting； you can confirm the subscription with the bookstore/7

§34. Georges Renard
i. Gramsci extracted the information on Georges Renard (1847-1930) from the obituary published in Les nouvelles littéraires 9, no. 419 (October 25, 1930).

The full title of Renard's "theoretical book" mentioned by Gramsci is Le régime socialiste: Principes de son organisation politique et économique (Paris: Alcan, 1921).

“Les cités imaginaires" was, in fact, the title of a course rather than a book by Renard.

§35. Italian Culture
1. See Curzio Suckert, Italia barbara [Barbarian Italy] (Turin: Gobetti, 1925), and Uarcitaliano [The arch-Italian] (Rome: La Voce, 1928)； the latter is a book of poems.

Kurt Erich Suckert published his early works under the name Curzio Suckert but later adopted the name Curzio Malaparte by which he is now generally known. See Notebook i, §8, n. 1.

2. Arturo Foà (1877-1944), a poet and publicist, was a fierce nationalist who vigorously supported Italy's intervention in the world war, a founder of Alleanza Nazionale in Turin in 1917, and later an ardent Fascist. Although he was Jewish, he remained a Fascist even after the publication of the Manifesto of Fascist Racism in 1938 and the enactment of the discriminatory anti-Semitic racial laws that followed it. In 1943 Foà was captured and deported from Turin to Auschwitz, where he died.

In his journalistic writings, Gramsci had criticized Foà on a number of occasions. In "La predica di Frate Agostino Gemelli” (The sermon of Brother Agostino Gemelli) in the Piedmont edition of Avanti! April 29, 1916, Gramsci remarks that "in seven lines one of the bards of Turin, Arturo Foà, managed to squeeze in twelve Latin tribes一and that's not counting the little details." A book of verse by Foà, Mentre la guerra dura (1917), elicited a scathing critique by Gramsci in one of his "Sotto la Mole" columns； see ^Letteratura Italica/' Avanti! April 19, 1917. It was, however, Foà's exaltation of militarism and war and his self-promoting patriotism that elicited Gramsci's harshest attack on him. In an article dripping with sarcasm一”Disciplina" in the "Sotto la mole" column of Avanti! April 25, 1918一Gramsci wrote, among other things: zz Arturo Foà did not go to the front line. It is true. But he was on the verge of going. Do not be malicious! Do not think of the choruses at the opera that sing zAndiamo, andiam7 [let's go, we're going] for half an hour and then retire behind the wings! Arturo Foà was on the verge, but while he was on the verge an order came from above [to go back]一and Foà obeyed.

§36. Lorìanism. Trombetti and Etruscan

I. Luigi Pareti, "Alla vigilia del io Congresso Internazionale etrusco” (On the eve of the ist International Etruscan Congress), Il marzocco 33, no. 18 (April 29, 1928)； "Dopo il Congresso etrusco" (After the Etruscan Congress), Il marzocco 33, no. 20 (May 13, 1928)； “Consensi e dissensi storici archeologici al Congresso etrusco" (Historical and archaeological agreements and disagreements at the Etruscan Congress), Il marzocco 33, no. 21 (May 20, 1928).

The first International Etruscan Congress was held in Florence on April 27-May 3, 1928. Gramsci writes about it in Notebook 3, §86. For the connection between Alfredo Trombetti and Etruscan studies, alluded to in the title of this note, see Notebook 3, §156.

On Luigi Pareti, see Notebook 3, §86, n. 3.

1. Gramsci is referring to Notebook 6, §16. For all the bibliographical information on Fracchia's open letter, as well as Gioacchino Volpe's speech, see Notebook 6, §16, n. 1.

On Gioacchino Volpe, see Notebook 1, §100, n. 3.

2. Giuseppe Giusti (1809-50), a Tuscan poet, is remembered mostly for his ironic wit and his satires against all forms of demagoguery and corruption and especially against Austrian imperial rule.

3. See Notebook 3, §63, n. 4.

David Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith point out: "The publication of foreign works and translations increased under the regime. 818 were published in 1935 as against 443 in 1932, and a total of 2,849 translated books came out in 1932-36." See A. Gramsci, Selections from the Cultural Writings, ed. D. Forgacs and G. Nowell-Smith, trans. W. Boelhower (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1985), p. 25311.

4- Gramsci read Erich Maria Remarquezs All Quiet on the Western Front (first published in Germany in 1928) in a French translation: À lfouest nen de nouveau, trans. A. Hella and O. Bournac (Paris: Stock, 1929). It is listed among the "Books delivered from Turi to Carlo on 11 November 1929” in the manuscript of Notebook 1； see 1:369.

5. See Notebook 6/ §i6.

6. On Carolina Invernizio, see Notebook 3/ §63, n. 11.

§39. Encyclopedic notions
i. Gramsci is here recalling something he had read many years earlier and had mentioned in one of his articles, specifically in "La mano dello straniero(The hand of the foreigner), Uordine nuovo, March 3/ 1922: "Before the war, as Bourget put it, there were three bulwarks of 'classical civilization, in Europe: the Vatican, the Prussian General Staff, and the British House of Lords/7

On Paul Bourget, see Notebook 3/ §37/ n. 4.

§40. Past and present. The English government
1. Gramsci very often uses "inglese” (English) where one would normally use z/britannico,, (British), although he does occasionally use the latter. Here, as elsewhere in this edition, it has been deemed preferable not to "correct" this idiosyncrasy.

2. See Rassegna settimanale della stampa estera, 5, no. 49 (December 9, 1930): 2752—53.

In 1930 Ramsay Muir also published a book on the same topic: How Britain Is Governed: A Critical Analysis of Modern Developments in the British System of Government (London: Constable, 1930).

3. Gramsci makes a similar point about Lord Carson in Notebook 1, §43. In his preprison writings, Gramsci mentions Lord Carson briefly in 〃I contadini e la dittatura del proletariato” (The peasants and the dictatorship of the proletariat), Uunità, September 17, 1926/ and at some greater length in "Russia, Italia, e altri paesi" (Russia, Italy, and other countries), Lfunità, September 26/ 1926. The relevant passage from the second article: Z/In 1914 . . . the English parliament was checkmated by a simple 'detail': Lord Carson armed 100,000 soldiers in Ulster to oppose the implementation of the law on Irish freedom. The regular army, made up of professional mercenaries, refused to march against Carson, who ended up the victor. Yet, during the war, the same parliament appointed Lord Carson minister, though he was guilty of a coup d'état and high treason/7

§41. Religion
1. Gramsci transcribed this quotation from Plutarch's Adversus Co-lotem (the parenthetical interjections are his) from the preface of a book on the history of religions by Nicola Turchi, Manuale di storia delle religioni, rev. ed. (Turin: Bocca, 1921). Gramsci had a copy of this book, which was sent to him toward the end of 1926 (the invoice from the bookseller Sperling and Kupfer is preserved in the archives of the Istituto Gramsci in Rome). It is listed among the "Books delivered to Carlo on 13 March 1931〃 in the manuscript of Notebook 2； see 1:529.

Plutarch's critique of Epicureanism, Adversus Colotem, together with all his writings other than the Lives, is conventionally published alongside his many other treatises under the general heading of Mor alia. This translation (by B. Einerson and P. H. De Lacy) is taken from the Loeb edition of Plutarch, Moralia (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), 14:301.

Nicola Turchi (1880-1964), a Catholic priest and professor of history at the University of Rome, wrote many important books on religion in the ancient world. In 1916 he was severely reprimanded by the Holy Office of the Vatican for publishing his work in a journal, Scienza delle religioni, that was considered "modernist."

2. Turchi, Manuale di storia delle religioni, p. 1.

3. This sentence, from Salomon Reinach's Orpheus: Histoire generale des religions (Paris: A. Picard, 1909), is quoted in French in Turchi, Manuale di storia delle religioni, p. 2 n. 1. In transcribing it, Gramsci rendered it into Italian. The text here translates Gramsci's Italian, and it differs somewhat from the published English version: Orpheus: A General History of Religions, trans. F. Simmonds (London: Heinemann, 1909).

§42. Tendencies in Italian literature. Giovanni Cena
1. Arrigo Cajumi, “Lo strano caso di Giovanni Cena” (The strange case of Giovanni Cena), L'Italia letteraria 1, no. 34 (November 24, 1929).

On Giovanni Cena, see also Notebook 2, §53, and note 1 there.

2. That is, "cavaliere" and "commendatore."

3. Gramsci is referring here to Aristide Briand (1862-1932), several times prime minister of France and foreign minister from 1926 to 1932, who strongly supported the League of Nations and whose many peace initiatives earned him the Nobel Peace Prize (with Gustav Stresemann) in 1926.

4. Enrico and Arrigo Cajumi were in fact cousins but had di任erent political orientations. In 1925 Enrico Cajumi, originally from Sicily, became the political editor of L'Ambrosiano, a pro-Fascist periodical based in Milan but controlled by the vice president of FIAT, Riccardo Guaiino (see Notebook 1, §50, n. 2). Arrigo Cajumi (1899-1955), born in Turin, was not a Fascist； among the journals and newspapers he published in was Piero Gobetti's Rivoluzione liberale. At his cousin Enrico's invitation, Arrigo Cajumi also contributed some articles to LfAmbrosiano一and this, it seems, is what confused Gramsci. See A. Gramsci, Cahiers de prison (Cahiers 6-9), ed. Robert Paris (Paris: Gallimard, 1983), p. 527.

5. In all likelihood, Gramsci is referring to Camillo Berra, a friend and fellow student at the University of Turin. In November 1913 Gramsci rented a room from Camillo Berra's widowed mother and "was to remain there [at 14 Via San Massimo] as Signora Berrai only lodger for nearly nine years, until his trip to Russia in May 1922. See Giuseppe Fiori, Antonio Gramsci: Life of a Revolutionary, trans. Tom Nairn (London: Verso, 1990), p. 89.

6. Cesare De Lollis (1863-1928), a romance philologist, was a professor at the University of Genoa before moving to the University of Rome. The author of many books on French, Spanish, and Italian literature, he was also the editor of La cultura. He was one of the signers of the 1925 Manifesto of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals.

7. All the quoted passages and the information pertaining to Cena contained in this note are derived from Cajumi, “Lo strano caso di Giovanni Cena/7 All the bracketed interjections are Gramsci's.

8. Camillo Prampolini (1859-1930) was a figure of seminal importance in the political organization of peasants, especially in the region of Reggio Emilia, where he was born. He helped found cooperatives and various associations for mutual aid. He also launched the militant periodical La giustizia. A member of the Socialist Party from the time it was founded, he was elected to parliament in 1892 and remained active in politics until the advent of Fascism.

9. Augusto Monti (1881-1966) was a prominent figure in Turin cultural circles. A professor at the Liceo Massimo D'Azeglio, he taught many students who would later become prominent, among them Cesare Pavese and Giulio Einaudi. La voce and La rivoluzione liberale were among the periodicals to which he contributed. I sansoussi (The carefree ones), one of several novels he wrote, was first published in 1929.

10. On Edmondo De Amicis, see Notebook i, §50, n. 3.

Lorenzo Stecchetti was the pseudonym of Olindo Guerrini (1845-1916), a poet influenced by Carducci but with a distinctive ironic voice, skillful in the literary use of dialect. He was a worldly poet with liberal leanings.

13. Giovanni Cena, “Che fare?” (What is to be done?). La voce i, no. 30 (July 7, 1910).

§43. The commune as an economic-corporative phase of the state
I. The Bardi and Peruzzi families； both Florentine, were two of the greatest financial powerhouses in Europe during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. They both went bankrupt for related reasons around 1345. Edward III of England could not repay the huge amounts he borrowed from them to finance his military ventures, the king of France confiscated their properties, and the king of Naples defaulted on his debts. The financial crisis that ensued had far-reaching effects, well beyond Florence.

1. Gramsci read the quotation from Francesco Guicciardini's Ricordi in Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, 〃I1 senso della letteratura italiana” (The meaning of Italian literature), Nuova antologia 65, no. 1387 (January 1, 1930): 2少

This maxim of Guicciardini's is in fact in his Ricordi (C: no). For the English translation, see Francesco Guicciardini, Maxims and Reflections, trans. Mario Domandi (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972), p. 69.

i. The allusion to Giuseppe Pitré's collection of popular Sicilian fables and tales, Fiabe e leggende popolari siciliane (1888) is in a short article by Domenico Bulferetti, 〃La volontà di dio” (The will of God), La fiera letteraria 4, no. 5 (January 29, 1928).

§49. Americanism. Babbit again
i. This note may have been prompted by two articles in a periodical Gramsci was reading at the time: A. Scalerò, "Nuovi orientamenti della letteratura Americana” (New orientations of American literature). Nuova antologia 65, no. 1388 (January 16, 1930): 259-65； and Arturo Calza, ^Uamericanizzazione dell'Europa?〃 (The Americanization of Europe?), Nuova antologia 65, no. 1388 (January 16, 1930): 266-69.

On Gramsci's firsthand knowledge of Sinclair Lewis's novel Babbit (1922) and for his other observations on it, see Notebook 4, §21, and n. 2 there； and Notebook 5, §105.

§50. Machiavelli
1. These brief indications regarding the "practical fortune" of Machiavelli are derived from an article by Antonino D'Elia, "Il cardinale Richelieu e lo spirito egemonico francese” (Cardinal Richelieu and the French hegemonic spirit), Nuova antologia 65, no. 1388 (January 16, 1930): 234— 5i； see especially pp. 235 and 247.

2. On Gramsci's view of Machiavelli as expressing the philosophy of his epoch, see Notebook i, §10.

§51. The siege of Florence in 1529-1530
i. Following the series of defeats and setbacks he inflicted on Francis I of France and his allies, the emperor Charles V achieved dominance over Italy, which was formalized by the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529. That same year； with the Treaty of Barcelona, Pope Clement VII (Giulo de' Medici), who had allied himself with the defeated French monarch, agreed to acknowledge Charles V's control over Italy, invest him as king of Naples, and crown him emperor. In return, however, the pope obtained from the emperor a commitment to overthrow the Republic of Florence and restore the Medicis to power. The imperial forces invaded Florentine territory and besieged the city in November 1529. Despite resisting fiercely, the republicans succumbed in early August of the following year.

2. The polemic started with an article by Antonio Panella, “Le anticipazioni di un centenario” (In anticipation of a centenary), Il marzocco 34, no. 38 (September 22, 1929). This was followed by a letter from Aldo Valori that was published (together with a response by Panella) under the heading "L'assedio di Firenze e la critica storica” (The siege of Florence and historical criticism), Il marzocco 34, no. 41 (October 13, 1929). Valori then wrote yet another letter, which was published (again accompanied by a response from Panella) under the title /zAncora l'assedio di Firenze e la critica storica” (More on the siege of Florence and historical criticism), Il marzocco 34, no. 42 (October 20, 1929). The argument was picked up again in an article by Aldo Valori, "Un centenario: La difesa della Repubblica Fiorentina (A centenary: The defense of the Florentine Republic), Critica fascista 8, no. 2 (January 15, 1930): 33-35.

What had triggered Antonio Panella's article in the first place was a book by Aldo Valori, La difesa della repubblica fiorentina (Florence: Vai-lecchi, 1929), that was typical of much Fascist historiography insofar as it attempted to fit the bravery of the Florentine republicans into a larger narrative of an uninterrupted glorious tradition of "italianità (Italianness) stretching back to antiquity. In his article, Panella criticized the historical distortions that such a revisionist approach entailed. In his Critica fascista article, Valori did not mention Panella by name； instead, he inveighed against all those supposedly hypercritical, purist, and by implication unpatriotic historians who chose to privilege the point of view of the foreigner (in this specific case, Charles V, a Spaniard).

On Antonio Panella, see Notebook 6, §13, n. 1.

3. Francesco Ferrucci was in command of troops outside the besieged city, engaging the imperial forces in a variety of places and attempting to break their encirclement of Florence. He was severely wounded in Gavinana, fell into enemy hands, and was killed by Fabrizio Maramaldo, an Italian from Calabria, who was a captain in the imperial army. Legend has it that Ferrucci's last words, addressed to Maramaldo, were: 〃You are killing a dead man.,/

On the pseudonymous Augur, see Notebook 2/ §32, and n. 1 there.

§54. On the English empire
1. Since the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, the Privy Council—that is, the private council of the British king or queen—has no political weight. The judicial committee of the Privy Council, on the other hand, functions as the court of final appeal for certain clearly delineated juridical matters pertaining to the United Kingdom, for British overseas territories and Crown dependencies, and, now, for those Commonwealth countries that have voluntarily opted to continue recognizing its authority.

2. See Augur, /zBritannia quo vadis?” Nuova antologia 65, no. 1388 (January 16, 1930): 252-58, especially pp. 256-58.

§55. Past and present. Arturo Calza
1. "Il farmacista” (The pharmacist) was the title of Arturo Calza's regular column in the Giornale d'Italia. On Arturo Calza, see Notebook 3, §i2iz n. i.

2. Alberto Bergamini (1871-1961) was appointed editor-in-chief of the Giornale dfItalia when it was launched by Sidney Sonnino in 1901. The mouthpiece of conservative liberalism, the paper supported the Libyan war as well as Italy's intervention in World War I. Although he had supported Mussolini's appointment as prime minister, Bergamini^ relations with the regime became strained, and he resigned from the newspaper in 1923. He was succeeded by his protégé Vittorio Vettori who had served as the paper's political editor since 1907. The Giornale d'Italia was taken over by backers of the Fascist regime in 1926, and Vettori was replaced by Virginio Gayda, one of the most militant and conspicuous propagandists of the Fascist movement.

3.  Arturo Calza, 〃/'La 'questione dei giovani7 e il manifesto dell,zUniversalismo/ " (The ,zquestion of youth" and the manifesto of/zUniversalismNuova antologia 65, no. 1389 [February if 1930): 299-301.

4. Filippo Crispolti, Un duello (Milan: Treves, 1900). Gramsci remembered the noveFs title as 〃I1 duello/, (The duel), whereas its title actually is Un duello (A duel).

5. Gramsci had been involved in a polemic with Crispolti over issues concerning the relations of religion (Catholicism), socialism, and politics. See, especially, Gramsci's article, “Rispondiamo a Crispolti" |A response to Crispolti)； Avanti! June 19, 1917.

Segrezs source is Joseph Addison, Remarks on Several Parts of Italy (London: Jacob Tomson, 1705), p. 207.

Innocent XI was pope from 1676 to 1689.

The marquis of Carpio, Gaspar de Haro, was the viceroy of Naples from 1683 to 1687.

§60. Naval issues

i. Gramsci's observations on this topic may have been prompted by an article signed Beta, "Disarmo ed equilibrio marittimo” (Disarmament and naval equilibrium), Nuova antologia 65/ no. 1392 (March 16, 1930): 232—40.

The broader context of this discussion on naval power is the set of agreements reached at the Washington Naval Conference (1921-1922) to limit or control the naval arms race among Britain, the United States, and Japan. Italy and France were also participants in the conference. One of the treaties signed as a result of the conference stipulated that Britain and the United States would maintain parity in naval power

2. Mr. Panerà (or Sor Panerà in Milanese dialect) was a creation of the actor and playwright Edoardo Ferravilla (1846-1916). A farcical character, Mr. Panerà spoke in dialect and almost entirely in clichés, and he frequently displayed his comical stupidity precisely when he thought he was being clever. The popularity of the Panerà character in vaudevillian theater induced Ferravilla to portray him on the screen. At one point in the film, El duell del sur Panerà (Mr. Panerai duel), Panerà is disconcerted by his adversary's movements and exclaims: "If he keeps on moving like that, I can't kill him!〃 See the annotation by Robert Paris in A. Gramsci, Cahiers de prison (Cahiers 6-9), ed. Robert Paris (Paris: Gallimard, 1983), p. 532.

One of the many books that the eminent medievalist Raffaello Mor-ghen (1896-1983) wrote on various aspects of the Middle Ages is devoted specifically to the decline of Swabian power in Italy: Il tramonto della potenza sveva in Italia (Rome: Tummirelli, 1936).

2. On Frederick II, see Notebook 5/ §31, n. 2.

2. Giuseppe Prezzolini, Mi pare ..・(Florence: Delta, 1925)； see especially the chapter on the state of the Italian theater and its failure to revitalize itself, pp. 71-79. Gramsci had a copy of this book in prison.

On Giuseppe Prezzolini, see Notebook 1, §8, n. 1.

§64. Father Bresciani"s progeny
1. Benedetto Croce, Cultura e vita morale, 2d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1926). Gramsci had a copy of this edition of Croce's book, and the references he provides are to its pages. The quoted passage is in the chapter "Fede e programmi” (Faith and programs), which was originally published as an article in 1911.

2. Here； again, Gramsci is quoting from the edition of Croce's Cultura e vita morale cited above, and specifically from the chapter entitled "Troppa filosofia“ (Too much philosophy), originally published as an article in 1922.

§65. Journalism

i. Gramsci's source for the bibliographical reference to Paul Guériot's book and the other information on Napoleon III in this paragraph is an article by Lorenzo Gigli, “Napoleone III prigioniero” (Napoleon III in prison), I libri del giorno n, no. 2 (February 1928): 70-72.

§66. Machiavelli

I. Gino Arias, "Il pensiero economico di Niccolò Machiavelli(Machiavelli^ economie thought), in Annali di economia (Milan: Università Bocconi, 1928), 4:1-31. In all likelihood, Gramsci learned of this article from a review by C. E. Ferri in I libri del giorno 11, no. 9 (September 1928], p. 560.

In a letter to Tatiana Schucht on March 14, 1932, Gramsci requested a copy of Arias's article (which he later received) and explained his interest in Machiavelli's economic thought:

If you happen to write to Piero [Sraffa], tell him on my behalf that I would like to know whether there exist any publications on Machiavelli's opinions on economics and political economy and whether he can, without inconvenience, obtain for me the memorandum published on the subject a few years ago by Professor Gino Arias in Annali di economia of Bocconi University. Is it possible to say that Machiavelli was a ^mercantilist, ff if not in the sense that he consciously thought like a mercantilist, at least in the sense that his political thought corresponded to mercantilism, that is, he expressed in political language what the mercantilists said in terms of political economy? Or could one go even so far as to maintain that in Machiavelli's political language (especially in the Art of War] there appears the first germ of a physiocratic conception of the state and that therefore (though not in Ferrari's or even in Foscolo's sense) he might be considered a precursor of the French Jacobins? |Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten； trans. R. Rosenthal |New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:150—51.)

Tatiana Schucht transcribed this letter (as she did many others) for Piero Sraffa and then transmitted Sraffa's response to Gramsci in her letter of April 27, 1932:

Piero wrote saying that he knows absolutely nothing about Machiavelli's economic thought； what little he learned from reading the article by Arias that you indicated seems, in his view, to confirm what you said. Piero thinks there is a strong analogy with a seventeenth-century English economist, William Petty, whom Marx called "the founder of clas-

sical economics." His works are impossible to find, but perhaps some bookstore might have a French translation of his complete works. We have had the Arias article sent to you and asked the bookstore to look for the book by Tangorra (cited by Arias) that contains an essay on Machiavelli as economist. There does not seem to be anything else (the only reference that was found is in an Italian translation of Schmoller, Lineamenti di economia nazionale, vol. i, p. 129, which alludes to Machiavelli as a mercantilist).

To which Gramsci responded on May 2, 1932: “I certainly don't need the works of William Petty to pursue the question of Machiavelli's ideas on economics. The reference is interesting, but it is enough.

For the complete text of Tatiana Schucht's April 27, 1932, letter to Gramsci, see A. Gramsci andT. Schucht, Lettere: 1926-1935, ed. A. Natoli and C. Daniele (Turin: Einaudi, 1997), pp. 989-90. For Piero Sraffa's April 21, 1932, letter to Tatiana Schucht, who, in turn, relayed almost verbatim his comments on Machiavelli and economics in her letter to Gramsci, see Piero Sraffa, Lettere a Tania per Gramsci, ed. Valentino Gerratana (Rome: Riuniti, 1991), pp. 58-59.

Gino Arias (1879-1940) held several academic appointments, including the directorship of the Syndicalist School in Florence. A prolific writer, he was a regular contributor to leading Fascist periodicals such as Gerarchia (which listed Mussolini as editor), Educazione fascista (edited by Giovanni Gentile), and Critica fascista. A prominent theorist and exponent of corporativist economics, he wrote, among many other things, Ueconomia pura del corporativismo (1930) and Corso di economia politica corporativa (1937). Arias also wrote a book on the economy of the medieval communes, 11 sistema della costituzione economica e sociale italiana nelPetà dei comuni (1905). Arias was Jewish, and despite his fervent support of the Fascist regime (he was one of the signers of the "Manifesto of Fascist Intellectuals" in 1925), he was compelled to leave Italy and emigrate to Argentina after Mussolini's promulgation of the racial laws in 1938.

§67. Italian culture. Valentino Piccoli
i. Sec Valentino Piccoli, "Un libro per gli immemori” (A book for the forgetful), I libri del giorno 11, no. 10 (October 1928): 600-601. This is a book review of Mario Giampaoli, 1919 (Rome: Libreria del Littorio, 1928).

Valentino Piccoli was a tireless Fascist propagandist. After serving as editor of the Giornale di Sicilia, he took charge of the Popolo d'Italia. He was also engaged in many book projects as author and general editor. In 1928-1929, he helped launch the book scries "I prefascisti” (The prefascists) for the publisher Augustea； he authored a book on Alfredo Oriani for the series. Piccoli also wrote several books on "illustrious" Italians, such as Dante, Leopardi, and Foscolo, all of which were meant to extol the greatness of the Italian national heritage. He was also entrusted with overseeing the complete /zdefinitive" edition of Mussolini's writings and speeches, the first volume of which appeared in 1934: Benito Mussolini, Scritti e discorsi [Milan: Hoepli, 1934).

Mario Giampaoli participated in the birth of the Fascist movement, that is, in the founding of the first "fascio di combattimento" in Milan on March 21, 1919. (As its title, 1919, suggests, his book is a glorification of the early history of Fascism.) He was a ringleader of the gangs that habitually intimidated and often physically attacked individuals and organizations or institutions deemed inimical to the Fascist cause. Eventually, Giampaoli's extremism became a liability, and his intrigues an embarrassment, even to a movement so steeped in violence and so disdainful of the law； he fell into disgrace and by the mid-1930s he was an outcast.

On Adolfo Omodeo, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 7.

3. Gramsci is relying on memory, and the phrase he quotes is not quite identical to the original一〃un outil tactique de premier ordre,z—in Anatole France's L'anneau d'améthyste (1899). The relevant passage occurs in chapter 2 of the novel, where, at one point, General Cartier de Chalmot intervenes in a conversation about the army and praises the French troops: "And if, like myself, you had spent the greater part of your life among soldiers, you would be agreeably surprised to note the qualities of endurance, good discipline, and good temper which make of the French trooper a first-class implement of war. I never tire of repeating it: such units are equal to any task. With the authority of an officer whose life's career is drawing to a close, I maintain that any one who takes the trouble to inquire into the spirit which animates the French Army will find it worthy of the highest praise” (Anatole France, The Amethyst Ring, trans. B. Dril-lien [New York: Wise and Co., 1930], pp. 49-50).

Bardi, Rome, 1930), was reviewed by Goffredo Coppola in Pègaso 2, no. 11 (November 1930): 622-26.

On Antonio Pagliaro, see Notebook 5, §29； n. 1.

Goffredo Coppola (1898-1945) was professor of Greek literature at the University of Cagliari before moving to the University of Bologna. He wrote several books, including monographs on Epicurus, Augustus, Callimachus, and the plays of Aristophanes and Terence. An unwavering Fascist and admirer of Mussolini till the bitter end, he was a member of the small group accompanying II Duce on April 27, 1945, when he was captured by partisans. Like his leader, he was executed the following day.

2. See Notebook 3, §74.

3. This is a slip of the pen by Gramsci； he is almost certainly referring to Coppola since the sentences that follow closely parallel what Coppola wrote on p, 623 of his review: "The assertion of identity between art and language leads to quite noteworthy results. Above all, the problem of the origin of language, which has troubled philosophers, psychologists, and linguists, turns out to be insoluble, since sound is itself an element of intuition or, rather, of man who intuits. Thus to ask what the origin of language as a faculty might be is the same as asking why man has an imagination, why man thinks, why man is man.〃

§72. Risorgimento
i. Angelo Ottolini, "Il centenario di Melchiorre Gioia” (The centenary of Melchiorre Gioia), I libri del Giorno 12/ no. 1 (January 1929): 21—25.

Melchiorre Gioia (1767-1829) abandoned the priesthood early in his career and devoted his life to the promotion of republicanism and the study of economics. He had already spent time in jail for his Jacobin allegiances when in 1796 he wrote the essay z/Quale dei governi liberi meglio convenga alla felicità dell'Italia" [Which of the free forms of government is most suitable for Italy). Only as a unitary republic, he argued, would Italy be able to take charge of its own destiny and bring an end to a long history of rule by foreigners. He would later be arrested again for anti-Austrian activities. Gioia, a critic of Adam Smith and a sympathetic reader of Bentham, produced a number of important works on economics and statistics, among them the 1818 treatise Del merito e delle compense [On merit and rewards) and the multivolume Filosofìa della statistica (1826).

§73. Father Bresciani's progeny

On Carlo Linati, see Notebook 3, §109, n. 3.

2. Gramsci is referring to Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944], who launched the futurist movement with the publication of his "Manifeste de Futurisme〃 in the Paris newspaper Le Figaro (February 20, 1909). He was a Fascist supporter from the moment the first "fascio di combattimento^ was formed at a meeting in Milan in March 1919, which Marinetti attended. In 1929 he was inducted into the newly established Accademia d'Italia together with Luigi Pirandello, Enrico Fermi, and Pietro Mascagni. In 1930 Marinetti and his follower Luigi Fillia published a "Manifesto of Futurist Cookery” (in the Gazetta del popolo, December 28) that enjoined Italians to develop modern, healthy eating habits and fulminated against the consumption of pasta, which it declared responsible for the nation's leth-argy7 pessimism, nostalgia, and other deficiencies. Not surprisingly, the attack on pasta provoked a furor, which Gramsci alludes to in Notebook 7, §35. Marinetti and Fillia also published a cookbook, La cucina futurista (Milan: Sonzogno, 1932), which contains a section on the polemics the manifesto had generated. For an English translation, see F. T. Marinetti, The Futurist Cookbook, trans. S. Brill (San Francisco: Bedford Arts, 1989).

For references to Gramsci's writings on futurism before his imprisonment, see Notebook 1, §124, n. 1.

§74. Cap or etto
1. Gramsci obtained all his information on Alberto Baldini's book Diaz (Florence: Barbèra, 1929) from a review article by Vittorio Giglio, "Il volto del vincitore" (The face of the victor), 1 libri del giorno ii, no. 7 (July 1929)： 4I3-I5-

2. Armando Diaz (1861-1928) replaced General Luigi Cadorna as ArmyChief of Staff after the military disaster at Caporetto in October 1917. He was able to reinforce his defenses and rebuild his forces, and, after repulsing an Austrian attack in midsummer, he went on the offensive on October 24, 1918. Ten days later, he defeated the Austrian Army at Vittorio Veneto, bringing an end to the conflict. Diaz served as war minister in Mussolini's government from 1922 to 1924

On Luigi Cadorna, see Notebook i； §44, n. 10.

3. On Caporetto, see Notebook 3, §20, n. 2.

4. With this observation and much of what follows, Gramsci is picking up the thread of his reflections on the significance of Caporetto that he had started a few pages earlier (i.e., Notebook 6, §69).

§75. Past and present
i. Mario Camis； "Intorno alle condizioni alimentari del popolo Italiano: Considerazioni statistico-fìsiologiche,, (On the nutritional conditions of Italians: Statistical-physiological considerations') La riforma sociale 33, no. 1-2 (January-February 1926): 52-81. Gramsci refers to this same article in Notebook i, §61.

§76. The function of czarism in Europe in the nineteenth century
i. Gramsci's source of information on this episode appears to have been the review article on the third volume of Bernhard Fürst von Bülow's Denkwürdigkeiten (Berlin: Ullstein, 1931) by Manfredi Gravina, "Il terzo volume delle memorie di Bülow77 (The third volume of Billow's memoirs), Nuova antologia 66, no. 1415 (March 1, 1931): 78-91. Gramsci's version of the quotation, however, differs slightly from Gravina^: Otherwise I would not have been able to have the socialists on my side/7

This is the relevant passage from the English translation of von Billow's memoirs:

Why was there this precipitate haste to declare war on Russia on August ist? The reason for our blunder in diplomacy； like those for so many oth-

ers we committed, must be sought in our domestic situation, or rather in the anxieties I caused the Chancellor. Albert Ballin gave me a very vivid description of a scene he witnessed that day, in the Chancellor's palace. ...Ballin allowed himself the question: "Why such haste to declare war on Russia, Your Excellency?^ And Bethmann answered: "If I don't, we sha'n't get the Socialists to fight/7

Ballin and I both gave this answer the same psychological explanation. The Chancellor had perceived the horrible situation he had brought upon himself and Germany. He shrank from responsibility. His first instinctive reaction was the desire to disarm the Left Wing elements he so dreaded, and he felt that this could only be achieved by making the War look anti-tsarist, now that he had not managed to keep clear of it. (Bernhard Fürst von Bülow, Memoirs of Prince von Bülow [Boston: Little, Brown, 1931-32], 3:187)

On Bernhard Fürst von Bülow, sec Notebook 2, §126, n. 2.

Theobold von Bcthmann-Hollwcg (1856-1921) had already served as Prussian minister of the interior when, following the resignation of von Bülow in 1909, Wilhelm II appointed him chancellor. He resigned from office in July 1917.

§78. The Italian Risorgimento

1. Regalism is the assertion of the authority of a monarch over the church in all temporal matters, including the control of ecclesiastical benefices. In Lombardy, this was sometimes called Josephism, after the Austrian emperor Joseph II, who claimed such authority. In theory and practice, regalism sought to diminish the power and privileges of the papacy. Its roots go back to Gallicanism, a late-seventeenth-century movement within the Catholic Church in France to restrain or more narrowly define the authority of the pope.

5. Peter Waldo (ca. 1140-ca. 1217), also known as Valdes, was a merchant from Lyon who underwent a religious conversion in 1176/ gave up his property, which he distributed to the poor, and devoted himself to the preaching of the gospel in the vernacular. He gathered a large following, and his disciples came to be known as the "poor men" or "Christ's poo" Despite violent persecution, the Waldenses spread across many parts of Europe. They were excommunicated in 1184.

6. See Ezekiel 3:18-20. As Derek Boothman has pointed out, Gramsci's source erroneously attributed 〃to King Ezekias or Hezekiah what is in fact a summary or paraphrase of the words of Ezekiel〃 (Further Selections from the Prison Notebooks’ ed. and trans. D. Boothman [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995], p. 535 n. 131).

The same chapter had been published earlier in another volume of Croce% Elementi di politica (Bari: Laterza, 1925), of which Gramsci owned a copy before his imprisonment. Elementi di politica (which was later incorporated into Etica e politica) has been translated into English； see B. Croce, Politics and MoralSf trans. S. Castiglione (New York: Philosophical Library, 1945). In the English translation, the chapter that Gramsci is referring to is entitled "The Unending Struggle Between Church and State” (pp. 183-191).

§82. Past and present
1. Many of Ugo Spirito's writings on the economic and political questions discussed in this note appeared in a journal he founded with Arnaldo Volpicelli, Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica, the first issue of which came out in November 1927. They are now collected (with other essays that Spirito originally published in the same journal and with responses to his critics, including those mentioned in this note by Gramsci) in Ugo Spirito, Il corporativismo: Dall'economia liberale al corporativismo. I fondamenti della economia corporativa, Capitalismo e corporativismo (Florence: Sansoni, 1970).

3. On the concordat, see Notebook 4, §53, n. 1.

4. Gentile's article Z/La questione romana” (The Roman question), published in the Corriere della sera of September 30, 1927/ was later included in Giovanni Gentile, Fascismo e cultura (Milan: Treves, 1928), pp. 182-88. The volume also contains some other writings by Gentile on the same topic； see pp. 189-205. Gramsci had a copy of this book in prison.

5. Gramsci is referring to a speech that Paolo Orano delivered in the Chamber of Deputies on March 29, 1930, in the course of a debate on the budget for public education. Orano argued that Fascism had no ties with idealist philosophy； the terminology he used (e.g., "philosophy of immanence") left no doubt that he was criticizing Gentile, who in many circles was regarded as the philosopher of Fascism. In its report on the speech, the Corriere della sera (March 30, 1930) quoted some parts of it, including the following: /zIt would be wrong to say that Fascism has entrusted any particular philosophy with the task of representing it and of determining its system of knowledge and interpretation of the world. The philosophy of immanence is conducive to teaching young people that the world is nothing other than a part of their selves, which results in a strictly individualistic conception of the world." Other reports and comments on Qrano's speech appeared in the press. See, inter alia, the comments that appeared under the heading z/Cronache del pensiero filosofico. Religione e filosofìa nelle scuole” (Chronicles of philosophical thought. Religion and philosophy in the schools), Gerarchia io, no. 4 (April 1930).

Pasquale Jannaccone (1872-1959, studied jurisprudence at the University of Turin, where he came to know Luigi Einaudi. Together, they founded the periodical La riforma sociale in 1894. Jannaccone was a professor of economics at the universities of Cagliari, Siena, and Padua before returning to the University of Turin in 1916. He was elected to the Accademia d'Italia in 1930.

9. See Benedetto Croce, "L'economia filosofata e attualizzata” (The economy philosophized and actualized), La critica 29/ no. 1 (January 20, 1931): 76-80. In this short article, Croce's critique is clearly aimed at Ugo Spirito, even though it does not mention his name.

10. Massimo FoveFs Economia e corporativismo (Ferrara: SATE, 1929) was amply praised in Ugo Spirito, "Verso Feconomia corporativa” (Toward the corporativist economy), Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 2, no. 5 (September-October 1929): 233-52； see especially pp. 239-46.

§84. Past and present. Continuity and tradition
i. Gramsci is referring here to his pagination of the manuscript. See Notebook 6, §79.

§85. The medieval commune as an economic-corporative phase of the modern state, Dante and Machiavelli
i. Dante articulated his political views and theories in some parts of the Convivio (written ca. 1304-6 and never completed), in his political epistles, and most systematically in the polemical treatise De monarchia (ca. 1310-13, in Latin). As Gramsci points out, however, Dante's treatise on the merits of the vernacular language, De vulgari eloquentia (ca. 1304 and left unfinished), is also "an act of national-cultural politics” (Notebook 29/ §7). In the treatise on monarchy, Dante refutes the claim of the church that the temporal ruler (i.e., the monarch or emperor) derives his authority from the pope and argues for the kind of proper relation between church and empire that was exemplified by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great.

2. See Franceso Coppola, 〃La croce e 1/aquila” (The cross and the eagle), Politica ii, no. 84-85 (February-April 1929): 35-53. This article praises the Lateran Accord (commonly called the concordat) between the Vatican and the Fascist regime. With his bombastic, nationalistic rhetoric, Coppola invokes Dante's political thought in a manner that makes it foreshadow the new treaty between church and state: "The idea of universal Monarchy alongside the universal Church, both of which God willed to govern the world, the Eagle and the Cross find their loftiest philosophical and poetic expression in the Italian genius of Dante who, moreover, turned on one side toward Caesar, an Italian, and on the other side toward St. Thomas, an Italian" (p. 50).

On Francesco Coppola, see Notebook i, §35, n. 1.

3. "The Blacks" refers to the Guelphs.

§86. Economic-corporative phase of the state
i. Paolo Treves, 〃I1 realismo politico di Francesco Guicciardini^ (Guicciardini's political realism), Nuova rivista storica 14, no. 6 (November-December 1930): 525-37. The article criticizes Francesco De Sanctis for misinterpreting Guicciardini and casting him in a bad light while exalting Machiavelli. According to Treves, ^Machiavelli was a political man, but he was also a revolutionary； Guicciardini was a political man, but above all he was a diplomat. One must pay attention to these differences in order to understand Guicciardini" (p. 525). A primary target of Treves's critique is the influential essay by De Sanctis, “L'uomo del Guicciardini," that was originally published in the Nuova antologia of October 1869 and later collected in Francesco De Sanctis, Saggi critici, ed. P. Arcati (Milan: Treves, 1924). (For a more recent edition that also includes "L'uomo del Guicciardini/; see Francesco De Sanctis, Saggi critici, ed. Luigi Russo [Bari: Laterza, 1979], 3:1-25.) Also important are the many pages devoted to Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and a comparison of the two in De Sanctis's Storia della letteratura italiana (1870-71)； see in particular chapter 15. Gramsci was very familiar with (and owned copies of) both works, as is evident from the many references to them scattered throughout the notebooks.

Paolo Treves (1908-58) was born in Milan, the son of the prominent socialist Claudio Treves. He studied at the universities of Turin and Milan and started working for the socialist paper La giustizia (run by Filippo Turati) in 1925. A militant socialist, Treves was closely watched by the police and arrested on a couple of occasions. In 1938 he took refuge in England, where he remained active in the circles of exiled Italian anti-Fascists. After the war, he returned to Italy, was elected to the Constituent Assembly, and subsequently served as a member of parliament.

2. The maxim "Pessimism of the intelligence, optimism of the will" is more often than not attributed to Gramsci, but Gramsci himself ascribed it to Romain Rolland (see Notebook 1, §63, n. 8). Until relatively recently, however, the famous saying could not be located in any of Rolland's writings, hence the many speculations on how or from where Gramsci learned about it and whether Rolland himself derived it from some other source. Frank Rosengarten has shed new light on the matter: "Rolland used the aphorism 'pessimism of the intelligence, optimism of the will/ in a review of Raymond Lefebvre's Le sacrifice dfAbraham published in Uhumanité (March 19, 1920): 'What I especially love in Lefebvre/ Rolland wrote, 'is this intimate alliance一which for me makes the true man一of pessimism of the intelligence, which penetrates every illusion, and optimism of the will'n (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 1:300 n. 1).

§87. Arms and religion
1. Gramsci's source here is the article by Paolo Treves, "Il realismo politico di Francesco Guicciardini^ (Guicciardini's political realism), Nuova rivista storica 14, no. 6 (November-December 1930): 525-37. Treves affirms: "Arms and religion are 'the vital and substantial components7 of states, without which it is impossible to governz, (p. 531), and he alludes to Guicciardini's Considerazioni al capitolo IX dei Discorsi del Machiavelli. In that work, Guicciardini wrote: 〃It is certain that arms and religion are the principal foundations of republics and kingdoms and so necessary that if either is missing one can say that vital, substantial parts are missing" (The Sweetness of Power: Machiavellis "Discourses" and Guicciardini's HConsiderations,ff trans. James B. Atkinson and David Sices [DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2002], p. 403).

2. As the sequence of binaries suggests, 〃ordet〃 is, in this case, analogous to force, coercion, lawz etc.； in other words, it means an order imposed or maintained by the authority or power of a state or a ruler Discipline, by contrast, is here used in the sense of governing one's own actions, acting out of convictionz having one's own sense of purpose； in other words, something that belongs to and comes from within an individual or a group. This is a conception of discipline that Gramsci had already articulated and expounded in his very early writings, where he associates discipline with the enhanced consciousness or awareness acquired through intelligent reflection and criticism, which for him are (or should be) the hallmarks of culture, especially socialist culture. In his article ''Socialismo e cultura” (in II grido del popolo of January 29, 1916), Gramsci wrote:

We need to free ourselves from the habit of seeing culture as encyclopedic knowledge, and men as mere receptacles to be stuffed full of empirical data and a mass of unconnected raw facts, which have to be filed in the brain as in the columns of a dictionary. . . . This form of culture really is harmful, particularly for the proletariat. It serves only to create maladjusted people, people who believe they are superior to the rest of humanity because they have memorized a certain number of facts and dates and who rattle them off at every opportunity, so turning them almost into a barrier between themselves and others. . . . Culture is something quite different. It is organization, discipline of one怎 inner self, a coming to terms with one's own personality； it is the attainment of a higher awareness, with the aid of which one succeeds in understanding one's own historical value； one's own function in life, one's own rights and obligations. But none of this can come about through spontaneous evolution. . . . The fact is that only by degrees, one stage at a time, has humanity acquired consciousness of its own value and won for itself the right to throw off the patterns of organization imposed on it by minorities at a previous period in history. And this consciousness was formed not under the brutal goad of physiological necessity, but as a result of intelligent reflection, at first by just a few people and later by a whole class. ... It was through a critique of capitalist civilization that the unified consciousness of the proletariat was or is still being formed, and a critique implies culture, not simply a spontaneous and naturalistic evolution. A critique implies precisely the self-consciousness that Novalis considered to be the end of culture. ... To know oneself means to be oneself, to be master of oneself, to distinguish oneself, to free oneself from a state of chaos, to exist as an element of order—but of one's own order and one's own discipline in striving for an ideal. ("Socialism and Culture,f, in Selections from Politica] Writings: 1910-1920, ed. Q. Hoare, trans. J・ Mathews [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990], pp. II-I3)

§88. Gendarme or night-watchman state, etc.
i. In his Arbeiterprogramm (1863), Ferdinand Lassalle derided the bourgeoisie for conceiving of the state as a night watchman. An Italian translation of Lassalle's Arbeiterprogramm was included in the eight-volume edition that Gramsci owned of K. Marx, F. Engels, and E Lassalle, Opere, 2d rev. ed., ed. Ettore Ciccotti (Milan: Avanti!, 1922).

In the English version of Lassalle's text, "Nachtwächter" is rendered as “policeman，' but the point Gramsci is stressing still comes through quite clearly:

According to the Bourgeoisie, the moral idea of the State is exclusively this, that the unhindered exercise by himself of his own faculties should be guaranteed to each individual. . . . The moral idea of the State according to the working class on the contrary is this, that the unhindered and free activity of individual powers exercised by the individual is not sufficient, but that something must be added to this in a morally ordered community——namely, solidarity of interests, community and reciprocity in development. In accordance with this difference, the Bourgeoisie conceive the moral object of the State to consist solely and exclusively for the protection of the personal freedom and the property of the individual. This is a policeman's idea, gentlemen, a policeman's idea for this reason, because it represents to itself the State from the point of view of a policeman, whose whole function consists in preventing robbery and burglary. Unfortunately this policeman's idea is not only familiar to genuine liberals, but is even to be met with not infrequently among so-called democrats, owing to their defective imagination. If the Bourgeoisie would express the logical inference from their idea, they must maintain that according to it if there were no such thing as robbers and thieves, the State itself would be entirely superfluous. (Ferdinand Lassalle, The Working Manfs Programme^ trans. E. Peters [London: Modern, 1884], pp. 52-53)

7. When Gramsci was writing this notebook (1931), the forthcoming publication of the volume of Cavour's correspondence dealing with the Southern question had been announced, but the book was not yet out. Gramsci probably learned about it indirectly from an article by Alessandro Luzio, "Studi cavouriani,/ (Studies on Cavour), Rivista storica italiana 48, no. I (January 1931): 1-18, and/or from an earlier article, also by Luzio, carteggi cavouriani,? (Cavour's correspondence), Nuova antologia 65, no. 1388 (January 16, 1930): 149-70. It also possible, however, that Gramsci was thinking of the fourth volume of the correspondence between Cavour and Costantino Nigra, which also deals with the South； see Camillo Benso di Cavour, Carteggio Cavour-Nigra dal 1858 al 1861, vol. 4, La liberazione del Mezzogiorno (Bologna: Zanichelli, 1929).

8. Giuseppe Ferrari's parliamentary speeches on the situation of the South were discussed in an article by Alessandro Lev] 〃I1 pensiero politico di Giuseppe Ferrari77 (Ferrari^ political thought), Nuova rivista storica 15； no. 3-4 (May-August 1931): 217-259； see especially pp. 253-255. Gramsci quotes from this article in Notebook 8, §49 and §218.

§92. Past and present
1. All efforts to find a copy of the issue of the periodical 19 that Gramsci refers to have been unsuccessful.

On Mario Giampaoli, see Notebook 6, §67, n. 1.

Antonio Aniante was the pseudonym of Antonio Rapisarda (1900-83)； born in Catania. He wrote experimental drama, as well as novels and biographies. In 1928 he published a biography of Mussolini in France. Rapisarda moved in circles associated with the avant-garde in the arts, contributed to Bontempelli^ modernist journal '900, and was part of the stracittà (supercity) movement.

2. Gramsci is referring to Emilio Lussu and, most probably, to Camillo Bellieni.

Camillo Bellieni (1893-1975), a major figure in the left wing of the Sardinian Action Party (of which he was a founding member), was widely regarded as the primary theoretician of the movement for Sardinian autonomy.

Emilio Lussu (1890-1975), a founding member of the Sardinian Action Party, was first elected to parliament in 1921. Toward the end of 1924 and in the early months of 1925, both Lussu and Gramsci were in Rome and used to get together on occasion. From Giuseppe Fiori； Antonio Gramsci: Life of a Revolutionary, trans. Tom Nairn (London: Verso, 1990): "Among non-communists, he saw Emilio Lussu of the Sardinian Action Party most often. They would go and eat together, and Lussu would ask about the Soviet Union while Gramsci inquired about the state of the peasant movement in Sardinia77 (pp. 189-90). In 1926 Lussu was assaulted (not for the first time) by a Fascist gang that went on a rampage following a failed attempt to assassinate Mussolini in Bologna. Lussu fired a shot in selfdefense and killed one of the assailants. He was exonerated by the courts, but the regime used the provisions of "the exceptional laws for the defense of the state" to sentence him to five years of exile bn the island of Lipari.

In 1929 he managed to escape and took refuge in Paris, where he joined the expatriate anti-Fascist movement.

§95. Italian culture. Regionalism
I. The bibliographical data and the comment on Leonardo Olschki's article are extracted from an item, “L'Italia all'estero” (Italy abroad), in the "Notiziario” (Bulletin) section of Leonardo 3, no. 2 (February 20, 1927): 48.

§96. Types of periodicals. Economics. A review of Italian economic studies
I. On Giorgio Mortarazs Prospettive economiche, see Notebook 1, §6i, n. 3・

Gramsci had a copy of the bilingual (French and English) publication of the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations, International Statistical Yearbook 1929 (Geneva； 1930).

The Dresdner Bank publication to which Gramsci is referring here was an annual entitled Les forces économique du monde, the first of which came out in Berlin in 1927. The third volume appeared in 1930. There is no record of Gramsci having had a copy of any of the Dresdner Bank annuals, nor is there any direct reference to their content in his notebooks and letters. He may have come across references to this publication in the Annali di economia 4, no. 2 (October 1928): 74, which cites the first volume in the series； and in Annali di economia 6, no 2 (July 1930): 61, which cites the third.

§97. Past and present. Lofty ambition and petty ambitions
1. It is not known where Arturo Vella uttered or wrote this statement. It is entirely possible that Gramsci heard him say it in a speech or in a private conversation.

Arturo Vella (1886-1943) was a member of the so-called intransigent wing of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). After the party schism at the Congress of Livorno in January 1921； Vella was among the most adamant opponents of the Communist Internationals call for the unification of the Italian Socialist and Communist parties, which had the support of the So-cialists，leader, Giacinto Serrati. In April 1923/ with Serrati being held in jail by the Fascist government； the PSI held its national congress in Milan； where it formally endorsed the maximalist position advocated by Vella, Pietro Nenni, and others opposed to collaboration with the Communists.

1. See, in particular, Notebook 4, §67.

2. In a speech he delivered in Rome on March ioz 1929, at the first quinquennial assembly of the Fascist regime, Mussolini said: "One must take into account that, in peacetime, the navy is the element that determines the hierarchy among states.The text of the speech is reproduced in Benito Mussolini, Discorsi del 1929 (Milan: Alpes, 1930), p. 31. Though Gramsci had a copy of this volume in prison, it appears that here he is quoting Mussolini from memory.

3. This "epigram" is in fact Gramsci's paraphrase or condensation of the opening paragraph of book 5, chapter 4, of Anatole France's Uile des pingouins (1908)； which Gramsci had probably read before his imprisonment:

The Penguins had the finest army in the world. So had the Porpoises. And it was the same with the other nations of Europe. The slightest amount of thought will prevent any surprise at this. For all armies are the finest in the world. The second finest army； if one could exist, would be in a notoriously inferior position； it would be certain to be beaten. It ought to be disbanded at once. Therefore, all armies are the best in the world. ... And it should be noticed that even after suffering the most terrible reverses an army does not fall from its position of being the finest in the world. For if nations ascribe victories to the ability of their generals and the courage of their soldiers, they always attribute their defeats to an inexplicable fatality. On the other hand, navies are classed according to the number of their ships. There is a first, a second, a third, and so on. So that there exists no doubt as to the result of naval wars. (Anatole France, Penguin Island, trans. A. W. Evans [New York: Heritage； 1947], p. 168.)

2. Franco Sacchetti (ca. 1332-1400), member of a prominent Florentine family, was a merchant before devoting himself to public life and serving Florence as an ambassador as well as in other important official capacities. He produced a substantial body of verse, including a number of pieces that were songs or readily adaptable to singing. His best-known prose work is Trecentonovelle, a sequence of short stories, many of which consist of anecdotes and vignettes； well over two hundred of them have survived. His other major prose work is Spozioni di vangeli (Expositions of the gospels) which is sometimes referred to as 〃Sermoni evangelici/7 Gramsci's views on Sacchetti were probably strongly influenced by Francesco De Sanctis, who, in chapter 10 of his Storia della letteratura italiana, describes Sacchetti as a man of average culture and little imagination whose best qualities were good sense, simplicity, and naturalness. Sacchetti^ mediocrity, according to De Sanctis, was a true reflection of his times, the triteness and crude form of his writings manifestations of a traditional and exhausted world. Sacchetti's moral and political reflections evince a desire for the tranquillity and equilibrium that supposedly typify or are a reward for occupying a middle station in life.

2. The basic thesis put forward by Arrigo Solmi in his booklet Uunità fondamentale della storia italiana (Bologna: Zanichelli, 1927) is typical of many nationalistic tracts of the time, namely, that Italy had an essentially unbroken history stretching from as far back as classical antiquity to the fascist present一hence ^fundamental unityin the title.

5. Carlo Cattaneo, La città considerata come principio ideale delle istorie italiane, ed. G. A. Belloni (Florence: Vallecchi, 1931). In this short work (originally published in segments in the periodical Crepuscolo in 1858I, as in other writings, Cattaneo underlines the paradigmatic importance of the Italian medieval city-states, or communes； in his view, they gave rise to modern, bourgeois civilization and its liberal ideals. This work may not have been published yet when Gramsci wrote this note, but he would have come across advertisements announcing its publication in the journals he had access to. It was not long, however, before the book was published and reviewed, and the reviews probably prompted Gramsci's comments in Notebook 6, §113.

On Carlo Cattaneo, see Notebook 2/ §22/ n. 4.

§105. Types of periodicals. Tradition and its psychological sedimentations
I. Pietro Gori (1865-1911), a lawyer born in Messina, was an indefatigable anarchist organizer and agitator who on more than one occasion used his legal skills to defend fellow anarchists. Arrested and imprisoned several times, he spent stretches of time away from Italy, avoiding persecution while continuing his militant activities. In 1895 Gori traveled to the United States, where for a year he crisscrossed the country from Boston to San Francisco, holding meetings and giving speeches promoting the anarchist cause. Later, he spent time in Argentina, where he helped found the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina (FORA). Gori also wrote plays and poetry, including a small book of verse, Alla conquista dell1 avvenire (To the conquest of the future), that was reprinted numerous times. As a writer, he was most successful with his songs— including the memorable "Addio Lugano bella〃 (Farewell beautiful Lugano)一that were immensely popular, especially among anarchists and militant workers.

Felice Cavallotti (1842-98) was born in Milan and fought with Garibaldi in the 1860s. A radical republican and fierce antimonarchist, Cavallotti was elected to parliament in 1873 and became one of the most popular leaders of the radical Left and a severe critic of Agostino Depretis's transformism and of Francesco Crispi's policies. His steadfast advocacy of democracy earned him the nickname "bard of democracy/7 An eloquent speaker, he also attacked his adversaries relentlessly, which led to endless lawsuits and numerous duels. In fact, he died in a duel with Count Macola, a conservative. Cavallotti produced a substantial body of poetry and drama (including verse drama)； though not regarded by any means as a major literary figure, much of his poetry had a politically rousing quality, and some of his plays enjoyed considerable success.

§107. Past and present
1. Croce contributed three "Postille politiche” (Political notes) that were published in Politica i, no. 2 (January 19, 1919): 206-12； i, no. 4 (April 24, 1919): 48-59； and 1, no. 7 (November 24, 1919): 13-17. The first two of these "Postille politiche" were later divided into four separate pieces with different titles一Sopravvivenze ideologiche” (Idelogies that lived on), "La guerra italiana, 1/esercito e il socialismo” (Italy's war, the army, and socialism), "Disegni di riforma nazionale" (Plans of national reform), and "La vittoria” (Victory)—and included in Benedetto Croce, Pagine sulla guerra, 2d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1928), pp. 250-55/ 218-26, 263-70, 287-90. The third of the "Postille politiche" became two pieces—"L'onestà politica" (Political honesty) and 〃La nausea per la politica(Nauseated by politics)一that were included in Benedetto Croce, Etica e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1931), pp. 165-69, 169-73.

When Gramsci wrote this note he had in his possession a copy of the tenth-anniversary issue of Politica that included a list of its past contributors. See Politica ii, no. 84-85 (February-April 1929): 26-34.

On Francesco Coppola, the cofounder of Politica, see Notebook 1, §35, n. I.

2. Guido De Ruggiero published the following articles in Politica: Z/Vico e Giannonez, (Vico and Giannone) in 1, no. 6 (September 30, 1919): 355-76； "Economia e legislazione” (Economics and legislation), which appeared in two parts, in i, no. 8 (December 31, 1919): 148-70, and in 2, no. 14 (June 30, 1920): 142-59； and /zL/idea italiana nella Repubblica partenopea” (The idea of Italy in the Parthenopean Republic), which also appeared in two parts, in 2, no. 16-17 (September 30, 1920): 38-56, and in 3, no. 19 (December 1930): 15-36.

On Guido De Ruggiero, see Notebook 4, §2, n. 2.

3. Three articles that Croce wrote for these journals—"Metodi polemici del nazionalismo italiano” (Polemical methods of Italian nationalism), in Italia nostra 2, no 2 (January 9, 1915)；/zSulla storia d'Italia" (On Italian history), in La critica 14 (1916): 399-400； and 〃I1 pensiero italiano e la guerra” (Italian thought and war), in La critica 15 (1917): 130-32一were republished in Pagine sulla guerra (Bari: Laterza, 1919), pp. 31-33, 131-42, 153-57.

Gramsci did not have a copy of Croce's Pagine sulla guerra but was familiar with its contents, on which he comments in a letter to Tatiana Schucht (April 18, 1932):

Croce's activity has distant origins and indeed goes back to the period of the war. To understand his recent works one must reexamine his writings on the war, which are gathered in two volumes (Pagine sulla guerra, second enlarged edition). <In fact, the 1928 enlarged 2nd edition consisted of a single volume of 358 pages.> I do not have these two volumes but I have read these essays as they were published. Their essential content can be briefly summarized as follows: a struggle against the orientation given to the war under the influence of French and Freemasonic propaganda, owing to which the war became a war of civilization, a war similar to the Crusades with the unleashing of popular passions that are close in character to religious fanaticism. After the war comes peace, that is, the conflict must be followed not only by renewed collaboration among the peoples； but the warring alliances must be replaced by peace alliances and it does not follow that these two coincide； but how could this renewed overall and specific collaboration be possible if an immediate criterion of utilitarian politics becomes a universal and. categorical principle? It is therefore necessary for intellectuals to resist such irrational forms of propaganda and, though not weakening their country in war7 resist demagogy and save the future. Croce always sees the moment of war in the moment of peace and that of peace in the moment of war and he addresses his efforts to preventing the destruction of all possibilities of mediation and compromise between the two moments. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:162-63)

These observations are incorporated in Notebook 8; §225.

For the polemic against Francesco Coppola that Gramsci is referring to here, see Cesare De Lollis, "Guerra per la guerra" (War for the sake of war), Italia nostra 2, no. 5 (January 31, 1915), as well as the unsigned article “La cena del Trimalcione” (Trimalchio's supper), Italia nostra 2, no. 19 (May 9, 1915).

1. See chapter 14, 〃Les critiques de Fescalier'7 (Critics after the event), in Georges Clemenceau, Grandeur et misères d'ime victoire (Paris: Pion, 1930)/ pp. 213-31. This work by Clemenceau is not among the books of Gramsci's that have been preserved, nor has any record been found of him having received it in prison. While this does not exclude the possibility that Gramsci did have direct access to Clemenceau's book, he may have read chapter 14 or an extract from it in some French periodical.

2. See Notebook 6, §86.

3. See, for example； the opening of chapter 14. The following is an excerpt from the English translation, G. Clemenceau； Grandeur and Misery of Victory (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1930):

I have been so bold as to liken M. Poincarézs articles on the Treaty to the lesson of a very careful master who shows up the trifling or serious mistakes of the good and bad pupils guilty of having set to work while the deus ex machina was philosophically twiddling his thumbs at the gates of the Elysée palace Nirvana.

I have patiently read through this universal indictment by a man who, knowing everything, did nothing: which allows him to make up for lost time by falling foul of those who attempted to do something. Everyone knows that ex post facto critics have the great advantage of putting us in a position to foresee the thing that has happened. This makes discussion much easier, (p. 250)

4. Clemenceau； Grandeur et misères d'ime victoire, p. 21711. The English version in Clemenceau, Grandeur and Misery of Victory reads, ^Diplomacy is an institution more for the maintenance of incompatibles than for the initiation of things not consecrated by tradition. In the word diplomat there is the root double, with the meaning to bendf, (p. 25511).

§111. Popular literature. Serial novels
1. See Notebook 6, §108.

2. The source of everything in this note up to this point (except for the allusion to Pozner) is a bibliographical survey by Edmond Jaloux in the section "L'esprit des livres/7 Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 435 (February 14/ I93i)・

Gramscfs transcription of the bibliographical information is incorrect, probably because of the somewhat confusing references provided by Edmond Jaloux. Thus the author of Le roman tenifiant is Alice Killen and not Reginald W. Hartland, as recorded by Gramsci. The correct bibliographical information is Etienne Servaisz Le genre romanesque en France depuis lfapparition de la “Nouvelle Héloìse" jusqu'aux approches de la Revolution (Paris: Colin, 1922)； Reginald William Hartland, Walter Scott et le roman frénétique (Paris: Champion, 1928)； and Alice M. Killen, Le roman terriftant du roman noir de Walpole à Anne Radcliffe et son influence sur la littérature frangaise jusqu'en 1840 (1915； reprint, Paris: Champion, 1924),

Gramsci refers to Alice Killen's Le roman terriftant accurately in Notebook 8/ §i2, where his source is a later issue of Les nouvelles littéraires.

The source of information on Jacques Rivière^ essay is, again, Jaloux's bibliographical survey. The essay referred to here was published in three parts； see Jacques Rivière, 〃Le roman d'aventure/' Nouvelle revue fran-gaise 5, no. 53 (May i, 1913)： 748-65； 5, no. 54 (June 1, 1913)： 9【4一32； and 5, no. 55 (July 1, 1931): 56-77«

3. André Moufflet's essay 〃Le style du roman-feuilleton〃 is cited in a different part of the same issue of Les nouvelles littéraires that contains Edmond Jaloux's bibliographical survey. See the unsigned "Du romanfeuilleton au sinanthropos pekinensis" in the "Revue des revues" section of Les nouvelles littéraires 10, no. 435 (February 14, 1931). Gramsci alludes to Moufflet's essay again in Notebook 17, §29, where his source of information is an unsigned note, "Stile e fortuna del romanzo d'appendice” (The style and reception of the serial novel) in the "Marginalia" section of Il marzocco 36, no. 6 (February 8, 1931).

2. See Benedetto Croce, Cultura e vita morale, 2d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1926), especially pp. 293-300 and. 265-71. Gramsci had a copy of this book in prison. The chapter "Fissazione filosofica” (Philosophical fixation) was first published in La critica 23, no. 4 (July 20, 1925): 252-56； and the chapter "Fatti politici e interpretazioni storiche” (Political facts and historical interpretations) was first published in La critica 22/ no. 3 (May 20, 1925): 189-92.

4. Gramsci is alluding, in particular, to the chapter libertà di coscienza e di scienza^ (Freedom of conscience and of science) in Croce, Cultura e vita morale, pp. 95-102. This chapter was originally published (as a critique of a book by Luigi Luzzatti with the same title) in Giornale ^Italia 9, no. 186 (July 8, 1909).

5. In Cultura e vita morale, Croce writes:

It is clear that the principle of tolerance that has been invoked cannot be extended to political struggles fought under the banner of religion. Do we lament the massacre of St. Bartholomew, or the burnings at the stake by the Inquisition, or the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors, or the burning alive of Servet? By all means, let us lament them； but we should also be fully aware that it is the stuff out of which poetry is made, not history. Those things happened, and no one can change them； just as no one can say what would have happened if those things had not taken place. The expiations that France and Spain made or should make for the supposed delicta maiorum arc a demand of a vindictive Judaism that should be left to the preachers； it has no meaning whatsoever. I would even call it immoral because those past struggles brought forth our present world, which now presumes to stand up before its forbear to insult it or, at the very least, to proclaim to it, have seen those faces myself!...

But even when it comes to theoretical struggles that resort to practical measures, the principle still does not apply, because to apply it one would first have to refute the doctrine of the volitional character of theoretical affirmation. I will not repeat what I have expounded elsewhere to support that doctrine and to prove that all of us, in every instant, exert pressure on the will of others in order to ensure that they think in the way that seems good to us. Everyone: including Luzzatti, who is no different with his many exclamation points and question marks that he makes part of his style and that are a way of repeatedly pulling the ear and poking the chest of his listeners and readers, (pp. 97-98)

§113. Risorgimento. The country and the city
1. Carlo Cattaneo, La città considerata come principio ideale delle istorie italiane, ed. G. A. Belloni (Florence: Vallecchi, 1931). Gramsci had already taken note of the work by Cattaneo in Notebook 6f §103.

On Carlo Cattaneo, see Notebook 2, §22, n. 4； and on his work La città considerata come principio ideale delle istorie Italian^ see Notebook 6, §103, 5-

When he wrote this note； Gramsci had just read two reviews of Bello-ni's edition of Cattaneo^ La città considerata, in Nuova rivista storica 15, no. 5-6 (September-December 1931): 583-85, and in L'Italia che scrive 14, no. 8 (August 1931): 227. Information that Gramsci gleaned from these reviews is woven into the opening three sentences of this note.

2. This is a reference to the seven-volume edition of Cattaneo's complete works: Opere edite ed inedite di Carlo Cattaneo, ed. Agostino Ber-tani (Florence: Monnier, 1881-1892). Gabriele Rosa and Jessie Meriton White Mario helped Bertani with his research and editing.

3. Gian Domenico Romagnosi [1761-1835), born in the Romagna region, was the author of important works in legal and political theory [as well as other books on statistics, economics, the history of mathematics, and other subjects) whose teachings and writings had a strong influence on some of the major intellectuals of Risorgimento and post-Risorgimento Italy. He published his first major work, Genesi del diritto penale (Origins of penal law), in 1791. Romagnosi was drawn to Jacobinism early in his career, joined a clandestine club, and wrote booklets that were bound to rouse suspicion, such as Cosa è Puguaglianza (What equality is) in 1792 and Cosa è libertà [What freedom is) in 1793. In 1799 he was accused of treason and imprisoned briefly in Innsbruck by the Austrians. When the French regained power in northern Italy, Romagnosi was appointed professor of law, first at the University of Parma and then, in 1807, at the University of Pavia, before becoming director of the Special School of Politics and law in Milan； he exercised considerable influence as a ministerial adviser. In 1815 he published Della costituzione di una monarchia nazionale rappresentativa, which was deemed subversive by the Austrians, who, restored to power, banned him. He continued teaching privately between 1817 and 1821； Carlo Cattaneo and Giuseppe Ferrari were among his students and faithful followers during this period. Arrested for treason in 1821, Romagnosi was banished to Venice for a while and, although his guilt was never proven, forbidden from teaching, even privately； he also had his passport confiscated, which made it impossible for him to accept the offer of a professorship at the University of Corfu. He spent the last decade of his life studying and writing in Milan, where he died.

The argument was kept going by Mario Puccioni, “Ancora Ricasoli, Salvagnoli e il 27 Aprile” (More on Ricasoli, Salvagnoli, and April 27th) in the "Commenti and frammenti" section of II marzocco 32, no. 51 (December 18, 1927).

5. Giovanni Nicotera (1828-94), a republican and follower of Mazzini, participated in the defense of the Roman republic against the French in 1849. He also played a leading role in Carlo Pisacane's 1857 expedition to Naples that ended tragically in Sapri. Severely wounded and captured by the Bourbon troops, he was to be executed, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He regained his freedom in i860 when Garibaldi's "expedition of the thousand" toppled the Bourbon regime. Nicotera joined Garibaldi in Palermo and fought alongside him in all his subsequent campaigns. Elected to parliament in 1861, he became a prominent and vociferous leader of the Left and served briefly as interior minister between 1876 and 1877. After that, Nicotera became increasingly conservative and authoritarian, and in 1891-1892 he again served as interior minister, this time in the first government of the Right, led by Antonio Di Rudini,

§115. Father Brescianfs progeny. Angelo Gatti
1. See Angelo Gatti, Ilia e Alberto (Milan: Mondadori, 1930).

Angelo Gatti (1875-1948), a military officer, was assigned to the supreme command in 1917 and served General Cadorna as a special secretary during the period of the Caporetto debacle. After retiring from the army, he wrote some books on military policy, before becoming a fiction writer and producing several novels and short stories. In 1937 Gatti was inducted into the Accademia d'Italia.

2. Gatti's novel Ilia e Alberto was reviewed in numerous newspapers and periodicals. In all likelihood, Gramsci read the review by Benedetto Migliore in the "Notizie e commenti” (News and comments) section of Nuova antologia 66, no. 1416 (March 16, 1931): 248-54, and possibly the very favorable review by Attilio Momigliano in Pègaso 3, no. 2 [February 1931).

§116. The Renaissance, (The economic-corporative phase of Italian history.) The origins of vernacular literature and poetry
1. Ezio Levi, Uguccione da Lodi e i primordi della poesia italiana (Florence: Battistelli； 1921)； Poeti antichi lombardi, ed. Ezio Levi (Milan: L.F. Cogliati, 1921).

Little is known about the thirteenth-century poet Uguccione da Lodi. His surviving work of certain attribution, Libro, consists of a poem or poems (the form and organization are unclear) written in two different verse styles in the Lombard-Venetian vernacular. It is a religious and didactic work of meditations on God's justice, the sinfulness of man, the corruption of contemporary society, eternal damnation, and the need for penance.

On Ezio Levi, see Notebook 4, §92, n. 1.

2. Salvatore Battaglia, “Gli studi sul nostro duecento letterario(Studies on thirteenth-century Italian literature), Leonardo 3, no. 2 (February 20, 1927): 30-33. This is the second of a three-part survey of published scholarly work on thirteenth-century literature in Italy. The discussion of Levi's contributions to the field and the brief quotations in Gramsci's note are all found in this segment of Battaglia's survey.

3. The Patarin reformist movement emerged in Milan in the second half of the eleventh century, Its adherents were pious and zealous lay-people who braved persecution in their drive to cleanse the clergy, the papacy, and the church in general of corruption. By the late twelfth century, other reformist movements considered heretical were also labeled Patarins.

4. See Felice Tocco, Ueresia nel Medioevo (Florence: Sansoni, 1884)； and Gioacchino Volpe, Movimenti religiosi e sette ereticali nella società medievale italiana: Secoli XI-XIV (Florence: Vallecchi, 1922).

Felice Tocco (1845-1911), who studied with Bertrando Spaventa and Luigi Settembrini, was professor of the history of philosophy at the University of Pisa and later at the University of Florence. In addition to his work on medieval heresies, he also wrote books on Plato, the Franciscans, Giordano Bruno, and Nietzsche.

On Gioacchino Volpe, see Notebook 2, §ioo, n. 3.

5. The other two segments of Battagliai survey were published in Leonardo 3, no. I (January 20, 1927): 6-8； and Leonardo 3, no. 3 (March 20, 1927): 58-61.

§117. Past and present

i. As he indicates； Gramsci translated this passage from volume 8 |p. 22) of the French edition of Karl Marx, Oeuvres politiques (Paris: Costes, 1931), a copy of which he had at the Turi prison. The English translation here is taken from Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Collected Works, vol. 14, 1855-1856 (New York: International Publishers, 1980), p. 552. The article by Marx and Engels from which this excerpt is translated was originally published in German under the title "Zu den Angelegenheiten in der Krim" in the Neue Oder-Zeitung of September 18, 185 5, and was dated September 14, 1855. In the French edition that Gramsci was using, the article was given the title "La question d'Orient/7 which Gramsci rendered into Italian as "Quistione orientale^ (Oriental question). In order to avoid confusion, it seemed preferable in this case to reproduce the title of the article that appears in the English edition of Marx and Engels's complete works一that is, Events in Crimea.

§118. The Renaissance

1. Gramsci is referring to his pagination of the notebook. See Notebook 6, §116.

1. See Notebook 3, §76, n. 1.

2. La voce, a political and literary review published in Florence, was launched by Giuseppe Prezzolini and Giovanni Papini in December 1908. Prezzolini remained its editor until 1914, when he passed it on to Giuseppe De Robertis. It ceased publication in 1916. L'unità, a weekly, was founded in 1911 by Gaetano Salvemini, who broke away from the Voce group with which he had been closely associated. Lfunità ceased publication in 1920. In 1912 Papini had a falling-out with Prezzolini, and the following year, together with Ardengo Soffici, he started Lacerba, a nationalistic and futurist periodical that folded in 1915.

On Giuseppe Prezzolini, Giovanni Papini, and Ardengo Soffici, see Notebook 1, §8, n. 1.

§121. Journalism
I. Gramsci derived his information on Albert Rival's book from its publisher^ advertisement in Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 438 (March 7； i93i).

§122. Types of periodicals. Reviews
i. Il foro italiano was founded in 1876 by Vittorio Scialoja and remains to this day one of the most important resources for law practitioners and researchers in Italy.

On Vittorio Scialoja, see Notebook 3, §27, n. 1.

§123. Past and present
1. In 1931 the journal Economia invited a number of economists—Albert Aftalion, Mario Alberti, André Andréades, Maurice Ansiaux, Georges de Leener, Charles Gide, Pasquale Jannaccone, F. W. Taussig, and C. A. Ver-rijn Stuart一to respond to a set of questions about the economic depression. Their responses were published under the title "La depressione economica mondiale: Opinioni degli economisti interrogati,z (The world economie depression: The opinions of the economists who were questioned), Economia 7, no. 3 (March 1931). The two articles Gramsci is referring to are Pasquale Jannaccone's response on pp. 297-306 and, commenting on the responses, Gino Arias, "La crisi e i giudizi degli economisti77 (The crisis and the views of the economists), on pp. 315-20.

On Pasquale Jannaccone, see Notebook 6/ §82, n. 8.

On Gino Arias, see Notebook 6/ §66, n. 1.

2. See Jannaccone's response in "La depressione economica mondiale/7 p. 30I/ which is also quoted in Arias, 〃La crisi e i giudizi degli economisti,n p. 3i6.

3. Jannaccone maintained that in the United States "the steep rise in the standard of living of all social classes slowed down the accumulation of savings'。see 〃La depressione economica mondiale/7 p. 300. According to Arias, the policy of high wages in the United States, which was meant to stimulate consumption, helped create the crisis； see "La crisi e i giudizi degli economisti,p. 316.

4. According to Arias, zzthe disproportionate rise in consumption by the working classes has slowed down savings and hurt production that one would want to protect and help grow" ("La crisi e i giudizi degli economisti,z, pp. 316-17).

5. Here Gramsci is directly refuting Arias's assertion that "the roots of the crisis are deeply moral and political/7 the decline in savings being only one facet. The other facets, in his view, included lack of economic discipline and "the anticorporativism that remains dominant in contemporary economics." See ibid., pp. 318-19.

§124. Croce and literary criticism

i. Benedetto Croce wrote the entry "Aesthetics" for the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica (1929). The Italian version of the text was first published in Italian with the title Aesthetica in nuce in a privately printed book (Naples, 1929). It was subsequently brought out by Laterza of Bari and also included in collections of Croce's essays. For the English version, see "Aesthetica in Nuce/7 in Benedetto Croce, Philosophy, Poetry, History: An Anthology of Essays, trans. Cecil Sprigge (London: Oxford University Press, 1966): 215-247； the passage quoted by Gramsci is on p. 237.

Gramsci most probably extracted the information about Croce's text, as well as the brief quotation, from a review by Natalino Sapegno, Pègaso 2, no. 12 (December 1930): 758-59.

§125. Types of periodicals. History and ei progress "

i. Gramsci is referring to King Alfonso XIII of Spain (1886-1941). Since Alfonso XII died before the birth of his son and successor, Alfonso XIII was literally born king. His mother, Queen Maria Christina, was the regent until 1902. Alfonso XIII abandoned both his throne and his country in 1931； his departure marked the beginning of the Second Spanish Republic.

§127. Industrial issues

1. Eugène Schneider, "Les relations entre patron et ouvriers: Les délé-gués de corporation,Revue des deux mondes 7, no. 55 (November 15, 1930): 372-88.

2. Gramsci is alluding to the factory councils he helped organize in Turin.

§128. Organic centralism, etc.

1. Eugène Schneider, "Les relations entre patron et ouvriers: Les délé-gués de corporation/^ Revue des deux mondes 7, no. 55 (November 15/ 193。)： 377-

"Being in command is nothing. What matters is understanding the persons you deal with and making sure they understand you. Understanding well一that's the secret of life."

2. Gramsci elaborates his critique of organic centralism at considerable length in Notebook 9, §68.

§129. Past and present. D'Annunzio's politics
1. Gabriele D'Annunzio's book Per VItalia degli italiani (Milan: Bottega di Poesia, 1923) resembles a miscellany； its contents consist of speeches, public "messages，' extended comments, "love documents,n and other texts. The title of the book (For the Italy of the Italian people) comes from a public speech D'Annunzio made in Milan on August 3/ 1923, in which he declared his support for Mussolini and fascism.

2. In a meandering passage in a section of Per lfItalia degli italiani entitled /zMessaggio del convalescente agli uomini di pena” (Message of the convalescent to suffering men), D'Annunzio alludes to the exaltation of peasants in his grandiose play La gloria (1899) and then goes on to say: "The supremacy of the peasant today seems right to me. In the midst of the decadence of all classes, isn't the peasant一strong, rugged, sober, tenacious, hale—the best today? Since he is the best, he should reign. It is right that he should reign" (p. 154).

3. In the summer of 1921, following an appeal made by Maksim Gorky for international assistance to alleviate the plight of the victims of the Russian famine, an international campaign was launched to raise funds to provide aid. In Italy, the Communist Party set up a committee to collect donations and forward them to the Soviet authorities. D'Annunzio made a substantial donation that caused quite a stir at the time. In Per Pltalia degli italiani, he explains and justifies his gesture:

Many charitable people were scandalized when I sent my donation to the famished Russians through the legitimate channel of the Communist Party. I know that these people were scandalized because one of my indiscreet friends revealed my "deep and fraternal compassion" for the extremely unfortunate Russians. He should have said "deep and fraternal gratitude/7 The Russian people, whose torment has been far more atrocious than Alexis had prophesied, have rid the world forever of a puerile illusion and a sterile myth. As a result of the most far-reaching and terrible experience connected to a human doctrine, it has now been proven, once and for all, that a government born out of class dictatorship is powerless when it when comes to creating tolerable living conditions. The field has now been cleared for the builders, (p. 286)

§130. Encyclopedic notions. Conjuncture
i. On the same topic, see Notebook 15, §16.

§131. Past and present. Characters
i. This is also the title of a book by Benedetto Croce, Etica e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1931), a copy of which Gramsci had at Turi. Though it does not appear that Gramsci is referring directly to Croce's work here, it is possible that his comment on "bad faith" and lack of conviction was prompted by an essay in Croce's volume entitled 〃La 'buona fede' 〃("Good faith")； see pp. 47-50.

§132. History of the subaltern classes
1. Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, La rivoluzione di Napoli nel 1848, ed. Francesco Torraca, Biblioteca storica del Risorgimento italiano (Milan: Dante Alighieri, 1912). The historian Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina (1816-90) first published his autobiographical account of the 1848 Neapolitan upheaval in 1850.

2. Gennaro Mondaini, I moti politici del '48 e la setta Unità italiana1 f in Basilicata, Biblioteca storica del Risorgimento italiano (Milan: Dante Alighieri, 1902). In addition to this book on nationalist political activists during the 1848 political turmoil in the Basilicata region, Gennaro Mondami (1874-1948) wrote a number of influential books on colonialism and Italian colonial law.

3. Guido De Ruggiero, Il pensiero politico mendonale nei secoli XVIII e XIX (Bari: Laterza, 1922), a study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century political thought in the Italian South.

On Guido De Ruggiero, see Notebook 4, §2, n. 2.

§133. For a new literature (art) through a new culture
i. In the opening pages of "Poesia latina nel seicento/7 chapter ii of Benedetto Croce's book on seventeenth-century Italian literature. Nuovi saggi sulla letteratura italiana del seicento (Bari: Laterza, 1931), Croce argues that in the seventeenth century, Latin poetry was composed primarily by priests, and especially by Jesuits, "for practical purposes, for edification and propaganda, and not out of any poetic motivation." He then goes on:

The two enormous volumes of the Parnassus Societas Jesu, published in

1654/ collects the poetry produced up to that year exclusively by Jesuits (leaving out, among others, the popes who were poets, Urban VIII and Alexander VII), and not even all of it. One finds confirmation of the entirely practical nature of such versifying in the pleasure and satisfaction with which the Jesuits (no differently from the poetasters of every period or from the "futurists" in our own time) celebrated the sheer volume of it and admired themselves for having been able in such a short span of time to bring forth so huge a mass of poetry in comparison to the sparse poetic production of the ancient and classical writers. The old Parnassus seemed like a hillock compared to high mountains or, rather, the chains of mountains that now stretched across one's field of vision. . . . And this self-conscious satisfaction (which is, after all, one of the strangest forms of unawareness that one can find) does not only remind us of the ^futurists, it also makes one think, naturally and without any effort, of the schools and academies opened by the Jesuits and other priests in which poetry was produced voluminously and of the /zschools of poetry" opened by the Bolsheviks in Russia where, even as they mock the wretched and stunted bourgeois past, they produce a continuous flood of Communist poetry based on a scheme that is astonishingly easy and proliferous.

Croce's Nuovi saggi sulla letteratura italiana del seicento is not among the books owned by Gramsci that have been preserved, but it is quite likely that he had a copy of it when he was in the Turi prison.

2. The connection between Croce and René Fülöp-Miller (1891-1963)— the author of, among many other things, a harshly critical book on Soviet culture一goes back to the year of publication of Ful0p-Millerzs Geist und Gesicht des Bolschewismus: Darstellung und Kritik des kulturellen Lebens in Sowjet-Russland (Vienna: Amalthea, 1926). Croce wrote a very favorable review of the book almost as soon as it came out； see La critica 24, no. 5 (September 20, 1926): 289-91. Gramsci read Croce's review and remarks on it in Notebook io, II, §i. As Gramsci surmises, Croce's derisory comment on the "schools of poetry" in the Soviet Union was most probably prompted by what he read in the chapter "The Mechanization of Poetryin Fülöp-Miller^s book； indeed, it almost seems as if Croce took Fülöp-Miller^ description of Bolshevik practice and used it to describe Jesuit poetic production. The relevant passage from the English translation of Fülöp-Miller's book reads:

Equally abstruse are the experiments which have been going on for a considerable time in the "Briusov Institute." There poetry is separated into its elements, analysed, and reformed； it is claimed that during the process it loses all kind of mysterious magic. Here receipts for poems are prepared, and the hope is openly expressed that soon writing poetry will be imparted to everybody, just like piano playing, reading, or writing. Henceforth, the art of poetry is to be a subject in the elementary schools, as drawing used to be； the children will be taught all the knacks and tricks, the mastery of which formerly brought undeserved fame to only a few.

In its aim of forming geniuses, the Briusov Institute has two sections at its disposal, the productive and the instructive； the one trains writers,

poets, translators, and critics of the "highest quality" in a three years7 course....

Out of five hundred and fourteen students, the Institute was able, after only a year's working, to point proudly to thirty-six graduate poets....

This is in truth the great achievement of revolutionary thought: that the connection between art and conditioned reflexes . . . has been definitely fixed, and that poetry has been defined as the mechanical combination of sounds and tones according to a chemical formula. However much opinions differ on whether poetry is better written by technical, physiological, or chemical methods, there is complete agreement that poetry has nothing whatever to do with intuition, endowment, or talent, for these are bourgeois and counter-revolutionary prejudices. (René Fülöp-Miller, The Mind and Face of Bolshevism: An Examination of Cultural Life in Soviet Russia., trans. ES. Flint and D.E Tait [London: Putnam, 1927L PP,巧4-55)

In a letter to Tatiana Schucht on May 2, 1932, Gramsci again refers to Fülöp-Miller in the course of a discussion of Croce's anti-Communism: "I've already mentioned how much importance Croce assigns to his theoretical activity as a revisionist and how, by his own admission, all of his efforts as a thinker during these last twenty years have been aimed at completing this revision [of Marxism], to the point of bringing about its liquidation. ... It seems to me that Croce is not up-to-date on the research and bibliography of his favorite studies or has lost his capacity to be critically oriented. Apparently his information is based especially on a notorious book by a Viennese journalist, Fülöp-Miller,/ (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. E Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:169).

When Fülöp-Miller^ book appeared in Italian translation一II volto del bolscevismo, with a preface by Curzio Malaparte (Milan: Bompiani, 1930)—Gramsci was very keen to obtain a copy but was forbidden from doing so by the prison censor After appealing the prohibition (see the letter of August 25, 1930, to his brother Carlo and the letter to Mussolini of September 30, 1930), he was eventually allowed to have it, and he wrote to Tatiana Schucht on December 1, 1930, asking her to have the bookstore send him a copy. The draft of Gramsci's letter to Mussolini is in the manuscript of Notebook 2 (see Description of the Manuscript for that notebook in vol. i).

§136. Organization of national societies
1. Gramsci is probably referring to Notebook 1, §47.

2. This was Gramsci's contention in his parliamentary speech of May 16, 1925, against the proposed law to ban secret societies. The law was ostensibly aimed at Freemasonry, but in fact it was a thinly veiled attempt by the Fascist government to suppress all oppositional organizations. An extract from Gramsci's speech:

Fascism has not yet succeeded in completely absorbing all other parties into its own organization. With the Freemasons it first tried the political tactic of infiltration, then the terroristic approach一burning down lodges； and, finally, legislative action, which will lead to numbers of key people in the big banks and the upper reaches of the bureaucracy going over to the winning side in order to safeguard their jobs. But the fascist government will have to compromise with the Freemasons. What does one do with a strong enemy of this sort? First break his legs, then when he is down force an agreement with him from a position of evident superiority... . Hence, we say that in fact this law is directed specially against the organizations of the workers. We demand to know why for many months now, although the Communist Party has not been declared an illegal organization, our comrades are arrested by the carabinieri every time they are found together in groups of three or more. . . . Since the Freemason movement will go over en masse to the Fascist Party and become one of its currents, it is clear that you intend to stop the development of large-scale worker or peasant organizations with this law. This is the real point, the real meaning of the law. Somebody in the fascist movement still has a nebulous recollection of the teachings of his former mentors, of the time when he too was a revolutionary and a socialist； he knows that a class cannot remain itself, cannot develop itself to the point of seizing power, unless it possesses a party and an organization which embodies the best, most conscious part of itself. Here is the grain of truth in this muddled, reactionary perversion of Marxist teaching.

Substantial parts of Gramsci's parliamentary speech are quoted in Giuseppe Fiori, Antonio Gramsci: Life of a Revolutionary, trans. Tom Nairn (London: Verso, 1990), from which the extract above is taken (with a couple of small modifications)； see especially pp. 194-96. The transcript of Gramsci's speech was printed in Uunità of May 23, 1925, and was published more recently in Antonio Gramsci, Contro la legge sulle associ azioni segrete, ed. Antonio A.

4. In his parliamentary speech, Gramsci also said: 〃We have had what we might call the program of the Corriere della sera, which represents a far from negligible national political force: 800,000 readers—they, too, are a party” (Gramsci, Contro la legge sulle associazioni segrete, p. 27).

Gramsci had a copy of this book in the Turi prison.

See also Notebook 6/ §8i, n. 1.

§140. Past and present
i. See the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Non abbiamo bisogno (We do not need), promulgated on June 29, 1931. The encyclical was written at a time when Catholic Action and other religious organizations were reeling from a coordinated assault (in many instances violent) by fascists. In the beginning of June 1931, the regime dissolved all youth organizations that were not affiliated with the Fascist Party's youth movement. Pius Xi's encyclical not only defended Catholic Action against accusations that it was interfering in politics to the detriment of the regime but also took aim at the government's coercive and totalitarian policies. The pope's characterization of the regime is at its harshest in the paragraphs that address the question of how Catholics should respond to the regime's demand that citizens take an oath of loyalty, an issue with a direct bearing on the claim (made by the Fascists) that the church had become a haven for the opposition if not even a de facto foreign power:

You ask us. Venerable Brethren, in view of what has taken place, what is to be thought about the formula of the oath, which even little boys and girls are obliged to take； that they will execute orders without discussion from an authority which, as we have seen and expected, can give orders against all truth and justice and in disregard of the rights of the Church and its souls, which are already by their very nature sacred and inviolable. Takers of this oath must swear to serve with all its strength, even to the shedding of blood, the cause of a revolution which snatches the young from the Church and from Jesus Christ, and which inculcates in its own young people hatred, violence and irreverence without respecting (as recent occurrences have superabundantly proved) even the person of the Pope.

When the question is posed in such terms, the answer from the Catholic point of view, as well as from a simply human point of view； is inevitably only one. . . . Such an oath is unlawful....

Realizing the many difficulties of the present hour and knowing that membership in the party and the oath are for countless persons a necessary condition of their career, of their daily bread, and even of their life itself； We have sought to find a way which would restore tranquillity to these consciences, reducing to a minimum the external difficulties of the situation. It seems to Us that such a means for those who have already received the membership card would be to make for themselves before God, in their own consciences, a reservation such as /zSaving the laws of God and of the Church" or "In accordance with the duties of a good Christian,z, with the firm proposal to declare also externally such a reservation if the need of it arose. {The Papal Encyclicals^ ed. C. Carlen [Wilmington； N.C.: McGrath, 1981], p. 455)       ..

The text of the encyclical was published in La civiltà cattolica, 82, no. 3 (July 18, 1931)： 97—122.

2. See the editorial "Dallo Stato alla Chiesa” (From the State to the Church), Crìtica fascista 9, no. 14 (July 15, 1931)： 261-62, which basically reiterated the injunction that the church should concern itself exclusively with spiritual matters.

See the review of Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey, Letties de jeunesse (Paris: Grasset, 1931L by Edmond Jaloux in the "Esprit des livres,, section of Les nouvelles litter air es 10, no. 460 (August 8, 1931). This review is Gramsci's source of the information on Lyautet and the quoted passage from his work that he recorded in this note.

Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey (1854-1934), a career soldier who rose to the rank of marshal, served in Indochina, Madagascar, and Algeria. In 1912 he went to Morocco, then a French protectorate, which he administered for over a decade. He served briefly as war minister of France in 1916-1917.

2. The count of Chambord (1820-1883) was the grandson of Charles X, and for one brief moment in 1830 it seemed possible that he would be named monarch； instead, Louis-Philippe ascended to the throne in a constitutional monarchy. He again came close to being enthroned in 1873, when the two royalist parties (the Legitimists and the Orleanists) held a majority in the parliament and sought to install Chambord as king. In the end, however, his rigidity and intransigence proved insurmountable as he refused to recognize the tricolor as the national flag一for the diehard monarchist it was a symbol of the Revolution.

4. Count Albert de Mun (1841-1914), a politician and prominent Catholic leader, was inspired by Leo XIIFs encyclical Rerum novarum (1891) to establish Catholic workers7 associations in France.

5. 〃A gentleman with a perfect education and charming manners, he thinks as we do on all matters religious and political. We speak the same language and understand each other wonderfully. What can I say? My heart burns with a fierce hatred of turmoil and revolution.

§143. Guido Calogero

i. Guido Calogero, 〃I1 neohegelismo nel pensiero italiano contempora-neo〃 (Neo-Hegelianism in contemporary Italian thought). Nuova antologia 65, no. 1402 (August 16/ 1930): 409-27. Gramsci quotes a long passage from this article in Notebook ioz I, §4.

Guido Calogero ( 1904-8 6 ) studied philosophy at the University of Rome, where Giovanni Gentile was his mentor. He worked for the Enciclopedia Treccani (which was directed by Gentile) while continuing his research in German philosophy. Calogero was, despite his close ties to Gentile, an antifascist and in the early 1940s was sentenced to internal exile.

§144. G. Pascoli and Davide Lazzaretti
i. This passage is from a preface that Giovanni Pascoli wrote for a school anthology. Sul limitare (Palermo, 1885). It is quoted in Giuseppe Papini； 〃Un poeta e un filosofo: Lettere di G. Pascoli e G. G. Barzellotti/Z (A poet and a philosopher: Letters by G. Pascoli and G. G. Barzellotti), Nuova antologia 65, no. 1404 (September 16, 1930): 162-77； see especially p. 167. Gramsci transcribed the passage from Papini's article and underlined /zun-certain,/ in the first sentence； the other emphasis is in Papini's article.

On Giovanni Pascoli, see Notebook i, §58/ n. 3.

On Davide Lazzaretti, see Notebook 3, §12, n. 1.

2. On Giovanni Boterò, see Notebook 3, §141, n. 2.

3. In his article (p. 9on)7 Zanette refers to the third volume of Carlo Gio-da/s La vita e le opere di Giovanni Boterò (Milan: Hoepli, 1895). Prompted by this reference, Gramsci must have been thinking of looking for more recent work by Gioda on Boterò. He was obviously unaware that Carlo Gioda (1836-1903) had been dead for almost three decades.

4. On what Gramsci means by "petty Italians/7 see Notebook i, §14.

§146. History of Italian intellectuals. The Jews
1. See Yoseph Colombo, “Lettere inedite del padre Hyacinthe Loy son (Unpublished letters of Father Hyacinthe), Nuova antologia 65/ no. 1403 (September 1930): 57-65.

2. Charles Loyson (1827-1912), better known in his time as Pére Hyacinthe, was a French theologian, Carmelite friar, and acclaimed preacher with a large following who adamantly opposed the dogma of papal infallibility enunciated at the first Vatican Council (1869-1870). He broke away from the Catholic Church, which excommunicated him, and founded a Gallican Church with a liberal orientation. Loyson corresponded with the rabbi Elia Benamozegh and wrote the preface to the French edition of Benamozegh^ posthumously published Israel et Fhumanité: Étude sur le Probleme de la religion universelle et sa solution (Paris: Leroux, 1914).

Born in Livorno, Elia Benamozegh (1823-1900) devoted his life to the study of theology as well as philosophy. He served the Jewish community of Livorno as rabbi and was also professor of theology at the rabbinical school in the same city. His voluminous wHtings include tomes on the kabbalah, extensive commentaries on the scriptures, and a comparative study of Jewish and Christian ethics. Benamozegh also studied and wrote on European philosophers, most notably Spinoza but also Rosmini and Gioberti. For an English translation of his posthumous book, see Elia Benamozegh, Israel and Humanity, ed. and trans. Maxwell Luria (New York: Paulist, 1995).

i. Ercole Reggio, "Perchè la letteratura italiana non è popolare in Europa” (Why Italian literature is not popular in Europe), Nuova antologia 65/ no, 1405 (October i, 1930): 298-307. The quoted passage is on. p. 298/ and the bracketed interjection is Gramsci's.

§148. The genius in history
i. See Niccolò Tommaseo, “Pio IX e Pellegrino Rossi” (Pius IX and Pellegrino Rossi), ed. Teresa Lodi, Pègaso 3, no. io (October 1931)： 402-25, especially pp. 407 and 415.

Pellegrino Rossi (1787-1848), a nationalist and a liberal, fled Italy following the defeat of Murat, whom he had served as a provincial administrator. After spending several years in Geneva, where he was a professor of law and a prominent political figure, he moved to Paris and was appointed professor of political economy at the Collège de France. In 1845 Louis Philippe appointed him ambassador to the Vatican. After Louis Philippe's abdication in 1848, Pope Pius IX appointed Rossi minister of interior. He was assassinated in November of that year in the midst of the turmoil that culminated in the establishment of the very short-lived Roman Republic in 1849.

On Niccolò Tommaseo, see Notebook 5/ §25； n. 1.

§149. History of Italian intellectuals
1. Gramsci's source of information on Paul-Henri Michel, Un idéal burn ain au XVe siede: Le pensée de L. B. Alberti (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1930) was a book review by Mario Bonfantini in Leonardo 2, no. 9 (September 1931): 395.

On Leon Battista Alberti, see Notebook 5, §55, n. 9.

2. On Le cento novelle antiche； o. Libro di novelle e di bel parlar gentile, detto anche Novellino, ed. and in trod. Letterio di Francia (Turin: UTET, 1930), see the review essay by Angiolo Orvieto, "Un nuovo 'Novellino'” (A new Novellino}, Il marzocco 36/ no. 1 (January 4, 1931), from which Gramsci almost certainly derived the information in the note.

Novellino is a collection of a hundred tales written in the late thirteenth century by an unknown but probably Florentine author.

3. See, for example, Notebook 3/ §76.

§150. Past and present
i. See Emilio Debono, "Diario di campagna” (Campaign diary), and Italo Balbo, 〃Da Perugia a Roma" (From Perugia to Rome), Gioventù fascista 1, no. 32 (October 25, 1931).

Emilio Debono and Italo Balbo, together with Michele Bianchi and Cesare Maria De Vecchi, were appointed quadrumvirs by Mussolini in the preparations leading up to the March on Rome (October 1922), which started in Perugia. The March on Rome was first conceived as a seizure of the state, and the quadrumvirs were supposed to be in control of the Fascist forces. In the end, events unfolded quite differently, and the qua-drumvirs did not play the decisive roles they had envisaged.

Before being named quadrumvir, Emilio De Bono (1866-1944) had participated in a number of military campaigns, with mixed success. The commander of the Fascist Militia when the Socialist member of parliament, Giacomo Matteotti, was murdered, he immediately found himself accused of complicity. Though indicted, he was ultimately exonerated. Subsequently, he was appointed governor of Tripolitania, and in 1935 he was at the head of the Italian forces that invaded Ethiopia, only to be replaced some time later by General Badoglio. Arrested Ì1U943 on the charge of participating in the conspiracy against Mussolini, he was executed early the following year.

A leader of violent Blackshirt squads in and around Ferrara, Italo Balbo (1896-1940), who had distinguished himself as member of the elite Alpini corps during World War 1, rose to the uppermost levels of the Fascist hierarchy. During his term as minister of aviation (1929—33), he became a legendary figure in Italy by successfully leading a fleet of seaplanes across the Atlantic and back. Ln 1934 Mussolini appointed him governor of Libya. In the Second World War, he was given command of the Italian forces in North Africa, He was killed by Italian gunners who mistakenly shot down his airplane near Tobruk.

§151. Catholic Action
1. The process of canonization of Robert Bellarmine (1542-1621) was formally started in 1627, but it was all but forgotten until Pope Pius XI revived it. On Robert Bellarmine, see Notebook 4, §S3, n. 10.

2. Guido De Ruggiero, review of Antonio Banfi, Vita di Galileo Galilei (Milan: Soc. Ed. La Cultura, 1930), La critica 29, no. 1 (January 20, 1931): 5^-54-

On Guido De Ruggiero, see Notebook 4, §2, n. 2.

3. See Antonio Bruers, "San Roberto Bellarmino/7 Gerarchia ii, no. 9 (September 1931): 765-70； especially p. 767: "The pontiff [i.e., Pius XI]Z who on June 29, 1930, canonized Bellarmine, author of the famous formula of the 'indirect power' of the pope over all civil sovereignties, is the same pontiff who five years earlier designated the last Sunday of October of every year as the feast of Christ the King." This was written in the periodical directed by Mussolini at a time of growing tension between the regime and the Vatican. The Fascists claimed that the church was infringing upon and perhaps even undermining Italy's national sovereignty. Gramsci comments on this problem in a number of different notes； see, for example, Notebook 6, §140.

On Antonio Bruers, see Notebook iz §99, n. 1.

§153. The national popular character of Italian literature.
Goldoni
1. Carlo Goldoni (1707-93), a Venetian, revitalized Italian drama when he infused a strong element of realism into his plays at a time when the commedia delFarte tradition was lapsing into tedium and formulaic predictability. He wrote some plays in Venetian dialect, and he excelled in the comedy of manners—see, for example, La locandiera (1753). Goldoni's innovations drew severe criticism from, among many others. Carlo Gozzi. He eventually moved to Paris, where he directed the Comédie-Italienne and tutored Louis XVI's sisters in Italian.

Preserved among Gramsci's books is a volume of Goldoni's plays: Carlo Goldoni, Commedie, ed. Piero Nardi, vol. 2 (Milan: Unitas, 1926)； he did not, however, have this book with him during his years in prison.

2. The playwright Carlo Gozzi (1713-86), a Venetian like Goldoni, adhered firmly to the commedia delParte tradition and actively defended it against innovators such as Goldoni. It was not only Goldoni's departure from tradition that drew Gozzi's ire but also his supposedly dubious morals, his sympathy for the popular classes, and his apparent disdain for the aristocracy, Gozzi wrote a set of extremely successful plays that are known as the Fiabe (Fairy tales), one of which, Turandot, was the basis of the famous opera by Giacomo Puccini (first performed 1926). The Fiabe evince the influence of, among other things, A Thousand and One Nights. Gozzi was widely acclaimed in his time； both in Italy and abroad； Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, and the Schlegels were among his admirers.

§154. The Saint-Simonians
i. Gramsci transcribed this quotation from the first segment of the fourth series of Maurice Barrès's Mes cahiers in Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 468 (October 3/ 1931).

This observation of Goethe's, however, is not in his memoirs but recorded by Johan Peter Eckermann in his transcription of an October 3, 1828, conversation with Goethe. For an English translation (slightly different from the one provided here), see Johan Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe, trans. John Oxenford (New York: Dutton, 1930), especially p. 264.

On Maurice Barrès, see Notebook 3, §2, n. 6.

§156. On ancient capitalism ...
i. The polemic Gramsci is referring to centered on the significance of the two ships built for the emperor Caligula that archaeologists were able to raise from the bottom of Lake Nemi (in the Alban Hills, southeast of Rome) in 1929-1932. The ships were not seafaring vessels but actually two very large barges that had been built specifically for use on the lake. Still, they provided archaeologists and historians with valuable insights into the technical capabilities of Roman shipwrights. Their size as well as the methods used in their construction revealed a higher level of sophistication than had hitherto been suspected.

The article that triggered the polemic was Giuseppe Lugli's 〃 A che serviva la nave di Nemi?” (What was the Nemi ship used for?), Pègaso 2, no. io (October 1930〕： 419-29. Lugli's views were criticized in an article by G. C. Speziale, “Delle navi di Nemi e del?archeologia navale” (On the ships of Nemi and naval archaeology), Nuova antologia 65, no.1407 (November i, 1930): 87-100. Speziale's attack elicited another article by Giuseppe Lugli, "Ancora sulla nave di Nemi” (On the Nemi ships again), Pègaso 2, no. 12 (December 1930): 744-50. This, in turn, led to one more article by G.C. Speziale, "Realtà e fantasia nella questione delle navi Nemi〃 (Reality and fantasy in the debate over the ships of Nemi), Nuova antologia 66, no. 1411 (January 1, 1931)： 117一3【・

2. Piero Gobetti launched the weekly Rivoluzione liberale in February 1922 and continued editing it until the Fascist government ordered it shut down in November 1925. Gobetti also founded the literary journal II Baretti (named after an eighteenth-century writer and critic* which started publication in December 1924. Il Baretti appeared twice a month until Gobetti's death in February 1926, after which it continued to be published monthly until 1928.

Armando Cavalli was a very frequent contributor to Gobetti's periodicals. He published over twenty-five articles in La rivoluzione liberale between 1924 and 1926/ in addition to nine articles in II Baretti between 1925 and 1928.

On Piero Gobetti, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 29.

3. On Davide Lazzaretti, see Notebook 3, §12, n. 1.

4. In April 1877, a group of anarchists led by Errico Malatesta and Carlo Cafiero attempted to stir up a rebellion by the peasantry in a mountainous area in the province of Benevento. They succeeded in occupying the villages of Letino and Gallo, where they raised the red and black anarchist flag. Troops were sent in, the uprising was quickly squashed, and all the ringleaders were arrested.

5. In the spring of 1870, there were a number insurrections in the South (Catanzaro) as well as the north (Pavia, Piacenza, and the Romagna). Pietro Barsanti, a fervent follower of Mazzini, led a rebellion in Pavia in March that was quickly suppressed. Barsanti was arrested, taken to Milan, and executed five months later. The "internationalists" Gramsci refers to were the anarchists who had drifted away from Mazzinian republicanism in the early 1870s.

6. On Ruggero Bonghi, see Notebook 2, §8, n. 1.

7. The daily La perseveranza, founded in 1860, represented the views of the Moderates in Lombardy. Ruggero Bonghi edited it for many years, starting in 1866. It ceased publication in 1920.

On Agostino Depretis, who was named pro-dictator of Sicily in 1860, during Garibaldi's campaign in the island, see Notebook 3, §119/ n. 1.

Luigi Carlo Farini (1812-66), at first a Mazzinian, was exiled from the papal states for revolutionary activities. Subsequently, he joined the Moderates and was close to Cavour, who entrusted him with many important posts and sent him as viceroy to Naples during Garibaldi's campaign in the South. The relationship between the statesman and the soldier was strained at best. He served briefly as prime minister in 1862-63.

On Francesco Crispi, who was opposed to the immediate annexation of Sicily to Piedmont, see Notebook 1, §43』n. 10.

On Nino Bixio, see Notebook i, §43, n. 26.

Agostino Bertani (1812-86), a surgeon from Milan, participated in the uprising against the Austrians in Milan in 1848 and was a strong supporter of Mazzini and Garibaldi. Bertani took part in the Expedition of the Thousand in Sicily, overseeing medical needs and logistics. A prominent leader of the Left, he served in parliament almost continuously from i860 until the year of his death.

2. See Francesco Crispi, I mille, with documents from the Crispi archive, ed. T. Palamenghi-Crispi, 2d ed. (Treves: Milan, 1927). Gramsci received a copy of this book during the period of his imprisonment in Milan. See Gramsci's letters of November 21, 1927/ to Tatiana Schucht, and of January 31, 1928, to his friend Giuseppe Berti.

§160. On morals
I. See Denis Diderot, "Lettres à Grimm et à Mme d'Epinay,'' ed. André Babeion, Revue des deux mondes 101, no. 4 (February 15/ 1931): 851-87. The quotation is from p. 852: “Diderot, who had the same respect for posterity that others have for the immortality of the soul ...〃

1. Emanuele Librino, “L'attività politica di Garibaldi” (Garibaldi's political activity), Nuova antologia 66, no. 1414 (February 16, 1931): 473-87.

2. General Giacomo Medici (1819-82) was a friend of Garibaldi's who fought with him in the 1859 war against the Austrians, the Expedition of the Thousand, and again against the Austrians in 1866. After the 1866 insurrection in Palermo, Medici was named prefect of the city.

§164. Catholic integralists, Jesuits, modernists
i・ When King Alfonso XIII abandoned the throne in April 1931, Niceto Alcalà Zamora (1877-1949), a Catholic former monarchist turned moderate republican, became prime minister of the Second Spanish Republic, Before long, however, he ran into trouble with the Constituent Assembly, In the drafting of the new constitution, the leftist republicans and socialists insisted on articles that would ensure a secular state, including the abolition of religious instruction in the schools and drastic restrictions on the rights of the clergy, as well as other provisions that did not sit well with antiliberal and integralist Catholics, such as voting rights for women. Zamora's efforts, backed by the Vatican, to dilute or attenuate the constitutional clauses that most directly impinged on and diminished the status of the church in Spain were rebuffed, and in October 1931 he was forced to resign, as was his minister of the interior, Miguel Maura. Two months later, however, he was elected the first president of the republic.

The antimodernist, integralist Catholics, meanwhile, led by Cardinal Pedro Segura y Saenz (1880-1957), archbishop of Toledo, battled fiercely against the forces of secularization. Segura, who was close to the fugitive King Alfonso and a diehard monarchist, fulminated against the republic in pastoral letters and other forums using rhetoric that left no room for compromise or accommodation. He was forced to leave Spain in 1931 and spent the following six years in the Vatican Curia.

All these events were amply covered in the major Italian newspapers, which enabled Gramsci to follow the course of events.

2. Enrico Carlo Lea, Storia della Inquisizione: Fondazione ß procedura, trans. P. Cremonini (Torino: Bocca, 1910). For the original in English, see Henry Charles Lea, A History of the Inquisition of Spain, 4 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1906-7). On the convoluted story of the struggle between the Jesuits and the Inquisition in Spain, which culminated in the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain in 1767 and subsequently the suppression of the Society of Jesus, in 1773, by Pope Clement XIV see 4:284-97. It is not likely that Gramsci had access to this book in Turi.

An article that Gramsci almost certainly read around the time he wrote this note was 〃La bufera anticlericale spagnola” (The anticlerical storm in Spain), La civiltà cattolica 82, no. 4 (November 7, 1931): 213-28.

§165. Encyclopedic notions. Science and scientific
i. See Henri \sic] Dubreuil, Standards: Il lavoro americano visto da un operaio francese, ed. A. Schiavi (Bari: Laterza, 1931). Gramsci had a copy of this book in Turi. For the English version of this work (originally published in French in 1929), see H[yacinth] Dubreuil, Robots or Men} A French Workman 's Experience in American Industry, trans. Frances Merrill and Mason Merrill (New York: Harper, 1930). This work, an authorized translation for the Taylor Society, deals at considerable length with issues related to Taylorism and industrial practices in the United States； it must have been an especially interesting book to Gramsci in view of his extensive inquiries into Americanism and Fordism. Gramsci's comments in this note were prompted by the following observation in DubreuiFs book:

Because of certain abuses and blunders, the expression /zscientific management,z has become almost a synonym for barbarous exploitation. It may be observed that in America the word "scientific" is used in a sense that cannot be translated exactly by scientifique, which has in French not only a more strict but a more abstract meaning than the corresponding American term. Thus one may construe the phrase "scientific managementas designating a set of methods aimed to embody the greatest possible common sense and logic, as distinct from the negligence of traditional routine. Such a phrase demonstrates the danger of translations that do not penetrate to the core of the meaning which every people puts into a term. (p. 6411J

§166. Past and present. Apolitical attitude
1. The exact title of Emilio De Bono's book on the Italian army before the Great War is Nell esercito nostro prima della guerra (Milan: Mondadori, 1931). The book was reviewed by Aldo Valori in the Corriere della sera of November 17, 1931.

On Emilio De Bono, who was minister for the colonies when he wrote this book, see Notebook 6, §150, n. 1.

2. See Giuseppe Cesare Abba, Uomini e soldati: Letture per l'esercito e pel popolo (Bologna: Zanichelli, 1890).

On Giuseppe Cesare Abba, see Notebook 1, §43, n. 27.

3. Just months before Mussolini appointed him a quadrumvir for the March on Rome, De Bono published a series of articles on political-military affairs in the antifascist newspaper II mondo； see the issues of February 28, March 21, April 28/ May 19, and June 6, 1922.

§167. Encyclopedic notions. Bog and bogati
i. In this case, Gramsci is avoiding the censor. The "someone" he alludes to is Nikolai Bukharin； the "somewhere" is Bukharin's booklet Programma kommunistov (bolshevikov), first published in Moscow in 1918. (An English translation of Bukharin's pamphlet appeared the same year it was first published in Moscow； see N. Bukharin, Program of the Communists [Bolshevists] [New York: Communist Labor Party, 1918].) Gramsci had published an extract from this work, “Chiesa c scuola nella Repubblica dei Soviet,/ (Church and school in the Soviet Republic), in Uordine nuovo I, no. 16 (August 30, 1919): 121-22. At one point in this segment, Bukharin makes an observation about the root of the word for "God" in Russian (Bog):

It is interesting that all the words that refer to the divinity testify eloquently to these origins [of religion]. What does "Bog〃 mean? It comes from the same root as 〃bogaty〃 [i.e., “rich"], God is the one who is great, powerful, and rich. How is God glorified? As the "Lord." What is a 〃Lord〃？ He is a master, the opposite of a "slave.〃 In fact, when we pray, we say: 〃We are your servants." God is also glorified as "the king of the heavens." All the other words for God have a similar meaning: conqueror, zzdominus,f, etc. A 〃dominus〃 is a person who dominates, rules over many others, possesses great wealth. What is God, then? God is, so to speak, really rich, a powerful lord, an owner of slaves, “ruler of the heavens,f, a judge—in short, God is the perfect copy, the exact equivalent of the earthly power of the chief, or the prince. When the Jews were ruled by princes who punished and tormented them in every possible way一that is when the idea of a cruel and malevolent God emerged. Such is the God of the Old Testament: a ferocious old man who inflicts cruel punishments on his subjects, (p. 121)

Gramsci published additional segments of Bukharin's Program of the Communists (Bolsheviks), under the general heading "Il programma del Partito comunista” (Program of the Communist Party), in Lfordine nuovo I, no. 19 (September 20-27, i9【9)： 146; i, no. 28 (November 29, 1919): 217-18； I, no. 29 (December 6-13, 1919): 225-26； 1, no. 30 (December 20, 1919): 239； I, no. 31 (December 27, 1919): 247； 1, no. 32 (January 3, 1920): 253-54； I, no. 34 (January 17, 1920): 268-69； L no. 35 (January 24-31,1920): 276-77； I, no. 36 (February 7/ 1920): 284-85； i, no. 37 (February 14, 1920): 292. A complete Italian version of Bukharin's booklet, Il programma dei comunisti (bolscevichi), was published in 1920 by the Avanti\ publishing house in Turin.

2. The Italian equivalent of the German word "reich” (rich, in English) is "ricco." The Italian words 〃dovizio〃 and "dovizioso" are translatable as "wealth" and 〃wealthy. 〃

3. The full title of Giacomo Leopardi's 1830 poem is "Canto notturno di un pastore errante nclYAsia” (Night song of a wandering shepherd in Asia).

3. See Giambattista Vico, Scienza nuova:

[132] Legislation considers man as he is in order to turn him to good uses in human society. Out of ferocity, avarice, and ambition, the three vices which run throughout the human race, it creates the military, merchant, and government classes, and thus the strength, riches, and wisdom of commonwealths. Out of these three great vices, which could certainly destroy all mankind on the face of the earth, it makes civil happiness.

[133] This axiom proves that there is divine providence and further that it is a divine legislative mind. For out of the passions of men each bent on his private advantage, for the sake of which they would live like wild beasts in the wilderness, it has made the civil institutions by which they may live in human society. {The New Science of Giambattista Vico, trans.

1. Gian Pietro Vieusseux (1779-1863), a successful merchant of Swiss ancestry, moved to Florence in 1819 and devoted the rest of his life to cultural and intellectual activities and publishing. In 1821 he established a scientific-literary club that attracted liberal intellectuals who in turn became contributors to Vieusseux's publishing initiatives, including the periodicals he helped launch, such as the influential Antologia (that first appeared in 1821), Il giornale agrario (1827), the Guida dell'educatore (1836), and the Archivio storico italiano (1842).

§172. Popular literature
i. Antonio Baldini, "Stonature di cinquantanni fa: La Farfalla petro-lieraz, (Discordances fifty years ago: The incendiary Farfalla), Nuova antologia 66, no. 1422 (June i6, 1931): 5。3-8. Much of what follows in this note is culled from this article.

Antonio Baldini (1889-1962), a critic and writer with ties to the La Ronda school of literary classicism, became editor-in-chief of Nuova antologia in 1931.

2. An unorthodox, bold, and innovative writer and publisher, Angelo Sommaruga (1857-1914) launched the iconoclastic and anticlerical La farfalla in Cagliari in 1876 but very soon after moved it to his native city of Milan. Sommaruga initiated many other publications, including the notorious Cronaca bizantina (founded in Rome in 1881), and founded a publishing house that brought out the works of some of the leading writers of the time, among them, Giosuè Carducci, Gabriele D'Annunzio, and Giovanni Verga.

3. Paolo Valera (1850-1926), who at the age of sixteen participated in Garibaldi's military campaign against the Austrians, was later a militant anarchist and socialist. He edited and contributed to various antiestablishment papers and periodicals, including La farfalla, and wrote popular novels depicting the life of the destitute and of social pariahs. The novels mentioned by Gramsci, Milano sconosciuta (The unknown Milan, in which the setting is the city's underworld) and Gli scamiciati (The shirtless) were published in 1879 and 1881, respectively. In addition to La plebe, mentioned in this note by Gramsci, Valera also edited two Milan papers La lotta (1880-83) and La folia (1901-4). In 1898 he was accused of subversion and had to spend time in prison. Toward the end of his life, Valera was a fascist sympathizer and even wrote a book on Mussolini (Mussolini [Milan: La Folia, 1924]).

On Filippo Turati, see Notebook iz §25/ n. 15.

4. In the late nineteenth century, a number of periodicals and papers in Italy were called La plebe. The one with which Paolo Valera was associated was founded by Enrico Bignami in Lodi in 1868. It was moved to Milan in 1875； it ceased publication in 1883.

5. Cesario Testa, a minor poet, who also published an Italian translation of the Latin poems of Pope Leo XIII, used the pseudonym Papiliuncu-lus. He was employed for some time at Cronaca bizantina, where, among other things, he proofread Carducci^ work. His verse is marked by a tone of defiance against divinity.

Ulisse Barbieri (1842-99) was a prolific writer, mostly of plays and opera libretti, many of them exalting the rebellion of the oppressed and nonconformists. One iconoclastic work of his is a composite of narrative prose, verse, and drama entitled Lucifero: Fantasia romantica (Lucifer: A romantic fantasy, 1871).

6. Antonino De Bella, Almanacco degli atei pel 1881 (Milan: Ambro-soli, 1881).

7. The French naturalists were highly praised in La farfalla. They were regarded as writers who spoke for the oppressed masses.

8. On Lorenzo Stecchetti (pseudonym of Olindo Guerrini)z see Notebook 6/ §42/ n. 10.

9. Giuseppe Aurelio Costanzo (1843-1913), born in Sicily, was a poet who also wrote some plays, the best known of which is I ribelli (1875). Gli eroi della soffitta (The heroes of the attic) is a long poem exalting the downtrodden that was quite popular in its time. First published in 1880, it went through several editions from the late nineteenth century until the end of the first decade of the twentieth century.

10. Giosuè Carducci wrote 〃A Satana” (Hymn to Satan) in 1863. The poem is a diatribe against religious obscurantism in which Satan is identified with the rebellion and triumph of reason. The poem concludes:

Hail, Satan, O rebellion,

O avenging force of reason!

Let holy incense and vows rise to you!

You have vanquished the Jehovah of the Priests.

11. These lines are from a love poem by Filippo Turati, "Fiori d'Aprile" (April flowers), that was published in La farfalla on April 24, 1881. It was included in an anthology of leftist poetry, Labor: Fiorita di canti sociali (Milan: Avanti, 1925), compiled by Alessandro Schiavi (who years later would write a book on Turati's final years).

12. The article by Raffa Garzia, who was Gramsci's Italian teacher at the lycée in Cagliari, is mentioned in a note by Luigi Piccioni, "Storia del giornalismo,/ (History of journalism), in the "Note e rassegne" (Notes and review) section of Nuova antologia 66, no. 1424 (July 16, 1931): 262-67.

Raffa Garzia played an important role in Gramsci's life. When Gramsci was his student,

Garzia was also the editor of UUnione Sarda, which一in spite of its very antiquated printing machinery—was still the largest circulation paper on the island. Garzia was strongly anti-clerical and inclined towards radicalism, and while he took good care to distinguish his position from that of the socialists, he did not hesitate to discuss them and their ideas in his pages, and sometimes even supported them....

Gramsci became Garzia/s favourite pupil at once. ... He would even invite him to his studio on Viale Regina Margherita, where the staff of U Unione Sarda held their meetings. At length the relationship between the two became a friendship.

At the end of the school year, in 1910,

Gramsci went to see Garzia before returning home. He was nineteen now, and wanted to try his hand at journalism； he had thought of writing brief pieces of local news from his home during the summer. Raffa Garzia agreed. . . . The young man left with an assurance that his first journalist^ presscard would soon be sent on to him. And indeed it was....

Gramsci's first piece appeared in L'Unione Sarda five days later, on

26 July, and is certainly his first published writing. It was twenty-live lines of straightforward reporting. ... It was signed with the abbreviation 〃gi.〃 (Giuseppe Fiori, Antonio Gramsci: Life of a Revolutionary, trans. Tom Nairn [London: Verso, 1990], pp. 55, 59)

§173. Catholic Action
1. Azione Cattolica e associazioni religiose77 (Catholic Action and reli

gious organizations), La civiltà cattolica 81, no. 2 (April 19, 1930): 167-72. The article deals with an issue at the center of the tensions between the Vatican and the Fascist regime, namely, the role of religious organizations (Catholic Action, in particular) in civil life. The Fascists feared that religious organizations, protected by the Vatican, could function as a cover for oppositional political forces. Gramsci touches on this issue in other notes in this notebook.                                       .

2. Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who would become Pope Pius XII in 1939, was the Vatican's secretary of state at this time.

3. Among the documents reproduced in the Civiltà cattolica article is a note that had appeared in the Vatican newspaper ^osservatole romano on March 30, 1930: 〃We know that the secretary of the Fascist National Party has issued a circular to the Provincial Authorities indicating that simultaneous membership in Catholic Action cannot be deemed in any way incompatible with membership in the Fascist National Party and hence, as has been expressly declared, with participation in the initiatives of the Regime. We are pleased to take note of this laudable provision that will serve to eliminate all conflicts and difficulties at the local level" (quoted in Azione Cattolica e associazioni religiose,p. 172).

§174. The Catholic Church

§176. Past and present
1. The memoirs and diaries of Clemente Solaro della Margarita were first published in Turin in 1851, with a second, revised edition appearing a year later. Gramsci obtained the information on the 1930 reprint from the "Bibliografìa" section of La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 2 (June 21, 1930): 537.

2. Giuseppe Brunati (1881-1949), a journalist and publicist who also wrote poetry and novels in the D'Annunzian mold, was the editor-in-chief of the weekly Monarchia (not II sovrano), published in Milan. (In Notebook 17/ §4, Gramsci recalls correctly that the periodical was entitled Monarchia.] In 1925, after Brunati and his associates at Monarchia broke away from the Italian Monarchist Imperial Association (AIMI)Z Brunati took charge of another monarchist weekly, Il sabaudo (The Savoyard), that had been founded in Turin the year before. As Gramsci correctly remembered, some of the propagandistic dicta emitted by II sabaudo were bizarre. For example, z/Purely communistic distribution is only possible under the Monarchy" and "Full-fledged Communism is to be found in its pure form in monarchic absolutismare two proclamations that appeared in II sabaudo 2, no. 19 (January 17, 1925).

§177. History of Italian intellectuals
1. Gramsci learned of this article by Angelo Scarpellini through a citation in the "Bibliografìa" section of La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 2 (June 21, 1930)： 543-44.

§178. Encyclopedic notions. Theopanism
i. "L'Induismo” (Hinduism), La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 3 (July 5, 1930): 13-26； the quoted passage is on pp. 17-18.

§179. Past and present. The vocational school
i. Gramsci read the report on the parliamentary debate in the Corriere della sera of November 26, 1931, and he later brought it up in a letter he wrote to his mother on February i, 1931: Z/I don't know how the preparatory school in Ghilarza is organized and what exactly the subjects for the entire course are. I've read in the Corriere della sera the discussion that took place in parliament concerning this type of school, but the topics that were dealt with were too general and vague for anyone to form a precise notion of it. The only important point that one could draw from this is that the preparatory school is not an end in itself but affords the possibility of a further scholastic career(Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press； 1994]/ 2:133-34).

It is also likely that this note was prompted by Arrigo Solmi's article Z/Le scuole d'avviamento professionalen (Vocational training schools) in Gerarchia n, no. 12 (December 1931): 965-69.

2. Gramsci had almost certainly read the article on the rural schools that Eugenio Faina started establishing in 1912, written by Claudio Faina (Eugenio's son), /yIl 'rinascimento agrario7 in Italia e le 'scuole rurali Faina7 〃 (The zzagrarian renaissance^ in Italy and the "Faina rural schools"), in Nuova antologia 65/ no. 1397 (June i, 1930): 392-400. Gramsci also comments on Faina's agrarian initiatives in Notebook 2/ §6s.

§180. Encyclopedic notions. "Scientific.What is tescientific77Ì
1. The Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932), a professor at the University of Turin, made major contributions to symbolic logic and set theory. Bertrand Russell, who met Peano at an International Congress of Philosophy in 1900, found Peano's notation system a valuable instrument of logical analysis and partly adopted it in his and Alfred North Whitehead's Principia Mathematica.

2. Gramsci is referring to F. Engels's Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (1892).

3. Filippo Turati's journal Critica sociale changed its subtitle. From the third to the eighth year of its publication (i.e.z between January i, 1893, and May iz 1898), it was subtitled Z/Rivista quindicinale del socialismo scientifico" (Bimonthly review of scientific socialism). Its publication was suspended for a while after that, and when it restarted on July 1, 1899, “scientific" was dropped from its subtitle, which became "Rivista quindicinale del socialismo^ (Bimonthly review of socialism).

On Filippo Turati, see Notebook i, §25, n. 15.

§181. The Catholic Church. The canonized and the beatified
I. The information is culled from a news report, "Beati e Santi dell'avvenire” (The Saints and the Beatified of the future), in the Corriere della sera of December 2, 1931.

§182. Catholic integralists, Jesuits, and modernists. Giovanni Papini
i. Giovanni Papini, Sant"Agostino, id ed. (Florence: Vallecchi, 1930), was reviewed in an unsigned article, "Intorno alla vita e agli scritti di S. Agostino” (On the life and writings of Saint Augustine), in La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 3 (July 19/ 1930): 152-58. Gramsci also comments on this article in Notebook 3, §57.

For a translation of Papini's book, see Saint Augustine, trans. Mary Prichard Agnetti (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1930).

Marquis Cesare Taparelli D'Azeglio (1763-1830), a devout Catholic and defender of papal authority, joined the Amicizie Cristiane (Christian friendship circles) when he was still in his youth. Later, when the movement modified its name to Amicizie Cattoliche (Catholic friendship societies or circles), D'Azeglio was one of its most active members and vigorous promoters. King Vittorio Emanuele sent him as a special envoy to Pope Pius VII in 1807 and again in 1814 (when Pius VII returned to Rome following the fall of Napoleon). In 1822 he founded the periodical L'amico d'Italia. He was the father of Massimo D'Azeglio.

2. The letter was from Filippo Crispolti to a priest, Tommaso Piatti, who had written a book in which he portrayed the organizational work of Pio Bruno Lanteri among the Catholic laity and clergy as an anticipation of (and as laying of the groundwork for) the formation of Catholic Action. See Tommaso Piatti, Un precursore dell'azione cattolica: 11 servo di Dio Pio Brunone Lanteri apostolo di Torino, fondatore degli Oblati di Maria Vergine, intro. Enrico Rosa, S.J. (Turin: Pontifìcia Marietti, 1926).

On Filippo Crispolti, see Notebook 3/ §37, n. 5.

3. /zCesare D'Azeglio e gli albori della stampa cattolica in Italia,n p. 193.

Pio Bruno (or Brunone) Lanteri (1759-1830) was studying for the priesthood in Turin when he met and became a follower of Nikolaus von Diessbach (1732-98), a Swiss convert from Calvinism who had been a Jesuit until the order was suppressed. Von Diessbach had founded the Amicizie Cristiane (Christian friendship) groups, and Lanteri participated in the work of these groups until they were banned. After the fall of Napoleon in 1817/ Lanteri revived the movement as the Amicizie Cattoliche, One of the characteristics of the movement was the special attention its members devoted to cultural work through, among other things, the dissemination of edifying books and periodicals. Cesare D'Azeglio and Joseph De Maistre were among the prominent and influential figures affiliated with the Amicizie, The movement was suppressed in 1829 by King Carlo Felice, who, though sympathetic toward it leaders, feared that its continuing existence would serve as a pretext for the formation of other associations with subversive or secret agendas. Lanteri also founded a religious order, the Oblates of the Virgin Mary.

4. Alessandro Manzoni wrote a long letter to Cesare D'Azeglio on September 22, 1823, in which he politely and very elaborately declined the invitation to collaborate in the periodical Uamico dfItalia. It was a private letter, and the matter was somewhat delicate because Cesare D'Azeglio's son, Massimo, was married to Manzoni's eldest daughter, Giulia. In 1846, however, the letter was published without authorization in Lfausonio, the paper of Italian émigrés in Paris. Afterward, Manzoni published it with some revisions, and it came to be generally known as the Lettera sul romanticismo (Letter on romanticism).

§184. Encyclopedic notions
1. The historian Gramsci is alluding to has not been identified.

2. Agnellus of Ravenna, who lived in the first half of the ninth century, is the author of Liber pontificalis ecclesiae Ravennatis, an account of the church, the churches, and the bishops of Ravenna from the fourth to the ninth century, Though by no means a reliable chronicle, Agnellus's work, with its many anecdotes and asides, is a very valuable source of information on various aspects of life in medieval Italy.

3. On Ludovico Antonio Muratori, see Notebook 5, §140, n. 6.

4. The national labor union Confederazione Generale del Lavoro (CGL) was founded in Milan in 1906； though autonomous, it had close ties with the Socialist Party.

5. Before Mussolini adopted it for his movement, the term "fascio" (plural, “fasci”、was used by a number of workers' and peasants' groups, such as the "fasci siciliani" (see Notebook 1, §43, n. 8). Here, Gramsci is referring specifically to the Partito Operaio Italiano (Italian Labor Party), which called the paper it launched in Milan in 1885 II fascio operaio.

§186. Catholic Action. In Spain
i. Gramsci came across this bibliographical item in the z,Opere pervenute” (Books received) section of La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 3 (September 20, 193。)： 572.

On Hughes-Félicité-Robert de Lamennais, see Notebook i, §71, n. 1.

2. See Notebook 6/ § 183.

3. Here, as elsewhere, Gramsci's "totalitario" has been translated as "totalitarian" to avoid any possibility of interpreting the meaning of the term in a manner that obscures or veils its nuances. As the contexts in which Gramsci uses the term suggest, he employs it consistently in the sense of "all・embracing〃 or ^all-encompassing./z

§189. Lorianism
i. In all likelihood, Gramsci's source of information on this exchange in the senate is the parliamentary news article "La riforma penitenziaria approvata dal Senato77 (Prison reform approved by the senate) in II corriere della sera, December 13, 1931.

§192. History of Italian intellectuals
I. Gramsci obtained the bibliographical information on this booklet by the medieval historian Gino Masi on the relations of the different political factions to the social strata of Florentine society in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries from the "Opere perventute” (Books received) section of La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 4 (December 20, 1930): 569-70.

In historical accounts of the modernist controversy, the name of Joseph Turmel (1859-1943) almost always turns up alongside those of George Tyrrell and Alfred Loisy； they are taken to be the three principal exponents of modernism, the major heretics in the eyes of the orthodox. Turmel, a theologian and church historian, wrote numerous scholarly works, including the six-volume Histoire des dogmes (Paris: Rieder, 1931-36), published after his excommunication. The index of prohibited books of 1948 lists all twenty-one books Turmel had published up to 1930, and, for good measure, it also lists a book on him by Félix Sartiaux, Joseph Turmel: Prètte, historien des dogmes (Paris: Rieder, 1931).

Gramsci owned one of the books that Joseph Turmel wrote under a pseudonym that was published as the twenty-fourth volume in the 〃Chris・ tianisme〃 book series mentioned in this note: Louis Coulange [Joseph Turmel], La messe (Paris: Rieder, 1927). Gramsci's copy of this volume is preserved with his books, and it bears the stamp of the Turi prison and the signature of the warden at the time； G. Parmeggiani.

On the Turmel case, see also Notebook 20, §4.

2. George Tyrrell and Cardinal Billot are not mentioned in the Civiltà cattolica article that Gramsci cites at the beginning of this note. Since he had a keen interest in the modernist controversy, he learned about them from a variety of sources. An article that discusses George Tyrrell and that Gramsci very probably read appeared in the fascist periodical Ger-aichia)see Fermi [sic], "La Spagna cattolica: Ieri e oggi” (Catholic Spain: Yesterday and today), in a section entitled /zCronache di pensiero religioso^ (Chronicles of religious thought), in Gerarchia ii, no. 12 (December 1931): 1072-73. (Elsewhere in this notebook, Gramsci cites another article from this issue of Gerarchia.}

George Tyrrell (1861-1909), born in Dublin in a family that adhered to the Church of Ireland, converted to Catholicism and in 1880 joined the Jesuits as a novice； he was ordained priest in 1891. A Thomist at first, his orientation shifted toward modernist thought by way of the philosophy of Maurice Blondel. After some of his writings raised serious questions about his orthodoxy, he was asked to recant his views, which he refused to do. Tyrrell was dismissed from the Society of Jesus in 1906. In 1907 he published two letters in the Times of London criticizing the encyclical Pas-cendi dominici gregis (Feeding the Lord's flock), in which Pius X formally condemned modernism, describing it as "the résumé of all heresies.He was excommunicated. Tyrrell provided the most thorough exposition of his modernist position in Christianity at the Crossroads, which he completed just before he died and which was published posthumously very soon afterward.

7. Émile Combes (1835-1921J was president of the council and minister of the interior between 1902 and the beginning of 1905. He spearheaded a struggle against clericalism with bills limiting the prerogatives of religious congregations and measures ensuring the secularization of public education. Combes's vigorous pursuit of strict separation between church and state led to a rupture in diplomatic relations between the Vatican and France in 1904. The alienation of French Catholics from the state was eventually remedied by the ralliement.

i. “Nel decimo anno della diarchia maltese” (In the tenth year of diarchy in Malta), La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 4 (December 20, 1930): 489-505.

In the wake of deadly riots that erupted on June 7, 1919, Britain granted the people of Malta a limited form of self-government. According to a constitution adopted in 1921, an elected Maltese government would have jurisdiction over local affairs (with, however, many restrictions on matters as diverse as trade and language policy), whereas the "Maltese Imperial Government,, (i.e., the British colonial administration) would retain control over everything else. The constitution also safeguarded interests and prerogatives of the Catholic Church on the island.

§197. The intellectuals
i. The courses offered by Eugenio D'Ors at the University of Madrid and the possibility of their being turned into books are brought up by Marcel Brion in the section ^Uactualité littéraire^ in Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 472 (October 31, 1931).

Gramsci had almost certainly also read the series of articles by Eugenio D'Ors, “La lettre, Pesprit et Vesprit de la lettre" that appeared in the Nouvelles littéraires between February 15 and March 15, 1930 (nos. 383, 385, 386, and 387).

Sergio Caprioglio has suggested that Gramsci derived the phrase ^sollecitare i testi” (importuning the text) from an article by Paolo Vita-Finzi, "Piani quiquennali ed economia a 'piano' " (Five-year plans and a 'planned' economy), La cultura n, no. 1 (January-March 1932): 560-80. According to Vita-Finzi, the statistics on productivity published by the Soviets were suspect because local officials supplied the government with inflated figures or distorted interpretations of data out of fear； they did not want to be regarded as laggards or subversives undermining the five-year plan. The data coming out of the Soviet Union, Vita-Finzi asserts, were unreliable because the ^government and the party had a political interest in importuning the texts [sollecitare i testi]." See Sergio Caprioglio, "Gramsci e PURSS: Tre note nei Quaderni del carceien (Gramsci and the USSR: Three notes in the Prison Notebooks}f Belfagor 46, no. 1 (January 1991): 65-75, especially pp. 66, 68. Caprioglio^ attribution has been disputed by, among others, Valentino Gerratana, in Gramsci: Problemi di metodo (Rome: Riuniti, 1997)； see especially p. 155 n. 6.

§199. Risorgimento. The Spanish Constitution of 1812
1. The Spanish Constitution of 1812 is also known as the Constitution of Cadiz, after the city where the Cortes had assembled while the country was at war with the French occupiers who had also imprisoned King Ferdinand VIL It was a paradigmatic liberal document that limited the power of the monarchy, established a unicameral parliament, and abolished many of the privileges of the nobility and the church. When Ferdinand VII was restored to the throne in 1814, he almost immediately repudiated the constitution and imprisoned the leading liberals.

3. A letter from Gramsci to Tatiana Schucht on June 29, 1931, provides explicit confirmation of his firsthand familiarity with Marx's writings on Spain that prompt his comments in this note:

Quite a lot of time has passed since I received the three volumes of Marx's Oeuvres philosophiques； which are translated in a most wretched manner. Of the Oeuvres politiqueSf Fve received only two volumes and I don't know to which numbers they correspond because I don't have them here in my cell right now: one is dedicated to Lord Palmerston the other does not have a single title (I'm quite sure it is the eighth volume of the political works) and it contains three brief series of writings: one about the English army during the Crimean war, one about General Espartero and Spanish politics during the early years of the 18501860 decade, and one on the capture of the Kars during the Crimean war. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:44)

The second of the two volumes Gramsci alludes to in this letter is the French edition of Karl Marx, Oeuvres politiques, trans. J. Molitor, vol. 8 (Paris: Costes, 1931).

Marx's article "Espartero" was first published in the New York Tribune, August 19, 1854. See Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Collected Works, vol. 13, 1854-1855 (New York: International, 1980), pp. 340-46.

It is, however, Marx's discussion of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 in an article entitled "Revolutionary Spain" published in the New York Tribune of November 24, 1854, that bears most directly on Gramsci's observations:

How are we to account for the curious phenomenon of the Constitution of 1812, afterward branded by the crowned heads of Europe, assembled in Verona, as the most incendiary invention of Jacobinism, having sprung up from the head of an old monastic and absolutionist Spain at the very epoch when she seemed totally absorbed in waging a holy war against the Revolution? How, on the other hand, are we to account for the sudden disappearance of this same Constitution, vanishing like a shadow ... when brought into contact with a living Bourbon [i.e., Ferdinand VII]?...

The Constitution of 1812 has been accused on the one hand . . . of being a mere imitation of the French Constitution of 1791, transplanted on the Spanish soil by visionaries, regardless of the historical traditions of Spain. On the other hand, it has been contended ... that the Cortes unreasonably clung to antiquated formulas, borrowed from the ancient fueros, and belonging to feudal times； when the royal authority was checked by the exorbitant privileges of the grandees.

The truth is that the Constitution of 1812 is a reproduction of the an- f cient Fueros, but read in the light of the French Revolution and adapted to the wants of modern society. . . . The formation of a State Council from a list of 120 persons presented to the King by the Cortes and paid by them—this singular creation of the Constitution was suggested by the remembrance of the fatal influence exercised by the camarillas of all epochs of the Spanish monarchy....

The meeting of the representatives in one single house was by no means copied from the French Constitution of 1791, as the morose English Tories will have it. . . . But even at the time when they were divided into brazos (arms, branches), representing the different estates, they assembled in one single hall, separated only by their seats, and voting in common....

The separation of the judiciary from the executive power, decreed by the Cadiz Cortes, was demanded as early as the eighteenth century, by the most enlightened statesmen of Spain； and the general odium which the Consejo Real, from the beginning of the revolution, had concentrated upon itself, made the necessity of reducing the tribunals to their proper sphere of action universally felt....

On a closer analysis, then, of the Constitution of 1812, we arrive at the conclusion that, so far from being a servile copy of the French Constitution of 1791, it was a genuine and original offspring of Spanish intellectual life, regenerating the ancient and national institutions, introducing the measures of reform loudly demanded by the most celebrated authors of the eighteenth century, making inevitable concessions to popular prejudice. (Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Collected Works, vol. 13, 1854-1855 [New York: International, 1980], pp. 424-25, 429-30, 431, 433)

4. The Sicilian Constitution of 1812 was the outcome of a struggle between the barons and the king of the island. With the support of the English commander, Lord Bentinck, the barons prevailed and produced a constitution that abolished feudal rights and guaranteed freedom of speech and the press； it also established a parliament but ensured that it would remain under the control of the nobility. The Sicilian constitution was suspended in 1814 when the realms of Sicily and Naples were merged in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

§200. Italian intellectuals
i. Pietro Giannone (1676-1744), a contemporary of Vico's and like him a Neapolitan, studied law and brought his legal theories to bear on the relations between the church and the state. In Istoria civile del regno di Napoli (1723), he interpreted the history of the Italian South in terms of a constant church-state conflict in which the state represented or embodied progress and civilization, while the church stood for reaction and regression. The church, in Giannone^ view, is free and autonomous as a religious or spiritual entity, but in temporal matters it is subordinate to the state. Istoria civile was a major and certainly bold intervention in the jurisdictionalist debates of the time. It was placed in the index of prohibited books, and Giannone was excommunicated. He took refuge in Vienna, where he received a stipend from the emperor Charles VI. While there, he wrote his three-volume magnum opus II triregno, ossia del regno del cielo, della terra, e del papa (The triple crown； or, The reign of heaven, earth, and the pope) in which he argued that the free development of the secular sphere cannot occur unless ecclesiastical power is curbed and the clergy is made to submit to the authority of the state. The work circulated in manuscript but was not published until 1895. Giannone had hoped to return to Naples after the restoration of Bourbon rule there, but in 1736/ while passing through Piedmont, he was arrested and imprisoned for the rest of his life. He continued studying and writing in prison, producing several books, including an autobiography.

3. The Sanfedisti were the bands of armed peasants organized by Cardinal Ruffo as his "Army of the Holy Faith." The term acquired a broader meaning over time and was used to refer to reactionary groups that supported papal power.

§201. Father B r es ciani's progeny. Bruno Cicognani
1. Bruno Cicognani's novel Villa Beatrice was first published in serial form in the periodical Pègaso 3, nos. 6-12 (June-December 1931) and later in book form by Treves of Milan in 1931.

On Bruno Cicognani, see Notebook 3, §154, n. 1.

2. Enrico Pea (1881-1958) was born near Lucca and spent some of his youthful years in Egypt. Several of his novels arc autobiographical. Pea also tried his hand at writing plays. Some of his works, such as the play La Passione di Cristo (1923), evince his religious inclination, while his fiction is often animated by an attachment to or a nostalgia for traditional mores and values.

1. On the concordat, sec Notebook 4, §53, n. 1.

2. Gramsci is alluding to a speech Mussolini gave at the capitol on December 3L 1925, at the inauguration of the first governor of Rome. The newspapers published the speech on January i, 1926. The speech contains no reference to negotiations with the Vatican. See "La nuova Roma/7 in Benito Mussolini, Opera omnia, ed. E. Susmel and D. Susmel (Florence: La Fenice, 1954), 22:47-49.

3. The bibliographical information (with some minor inaccuracies) and a brief note on Wilfrid Parsons, The Pope and Italy (New York: American, 1929) appeared in the //Bibliografia,/ section of La civiltà cattolica 82, no. 4 (December 19, 1931): 547-48.

§205. Encyclopedic notions. Direct action
i. Gramsci is referring to two major strands of anarchism: individualist anarchism and mutualism, generally associated with Proudhon, and the

anarcho-communism (also called anarchist communism) generally associated with the Italian section of the First International and its leaders. Carlo Cafiero, Errico Malatesta, and Andrea Costa. The anarcho-commu-nists, who stressed egalitarianism and collectivism^ formally enunciated their principles at a clandestine meeting in Florence in 1876.

2. An example of this is provided by James Joll in his account of the aftermath of the riots that broke out in Ancona in 1898:

[Malatesta] had gone to the port of Ancona, where there was an active anarchist group among the dockers and several anarchist publications, opposing those anarchists like Saverino Merlino who felt that in an emergency anarchists should participate in elections to support the liberal and social-democratic cause. . . . Malatesta was arrested after riots in Ancona and charged with "criminal association”—a charge, with its implication that anarchists were no better than common criminals, which brought a cry of rage from the international anarchist community. In the event, Malatesta and his friends were convicted of belonging to a ^seditious association." (James Joll, The Anarchists [Boston: Little Brown, 1964], P- VS)

2. Bertoldo, a coarse, ungainly, but astute and crafty peasant, and his slow-witted son, Bertoldino, are the main characters in the popular tales by Giulio Cesare Croce (1550-1609), a Bolognese storyteller. Croce first published the stories (which over the years have been adapted for the theater and the cinema) in two booklets: Le sottilissime astuzie di Bertoldo (The most subtle cunning of Bertoldo) and Le piacevoli e ridicolose simplicità di Bertoldino (The amusing and ridiculous simplicities of Bertoldino).

3. For the use of "meschino" in Dante's Vita nuova, see chapter 9/ sonnet 5, line 5.

§208. Popular literature. R. Giovagnoli's Spartaco
1. Garibaldi's letter to Raffaele Giovagnoli was reproduced in a news story published under the headline "La lettera di Garibaldi donata dal Duce al Museo del Risorgimento” (The letter of Garibaldi donated by the Duce to the Museum of the Risorgimento) in II corriere della sera, January 8, I932・

David Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith provide some very interesting information in their annotation of this note:

See Raffaele Giovagnoli, Spartaco, ed. L. Russo, Florence, 1955, where Garibaldi's letter is reprinted in the prefatory material. Giovagnoli (1838-1915), who fought with Garibaldi in i860 and 1863, wrote one of the first histories of the Risorgimento [Risorgimento italiano dal 1815 al 1848 (Milan: E Vallardi, 1912)] and a book on the Roman revolution of 1848-49. Spartaco (1874) deals with the liberation of the slaves by Spartacus and the rebel gladiators in 73-71 b.c. Gramsci's suggestion in this note about republishing a modernized version of the novel was followed to the letter by the PCI in the early 1950s when the review Vie Nuove serialized it. The party began serializing fiction in 1949 on the pages of U Unità, polling readers' choices. The first two were Gorky and Jack London. (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from Cultural Writings, ed.

D. Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans. W. Boelhower [London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1985], p. 35211)

2. Garibaldi wrote two historical novels, Cantoni il volontario (Milan: E. Politti, 1870) and Clelia: Il governo del Monaco (Milan: Fratelli Rechiedi, 1870), which was translated into English as The Rule of the Monk； or, Rome in the Nineteenth Century (New York: Harper, 1870).

3. "Molodaia Gvardia” (Young Guard), a Russian revolutionary song, was sung to the tune of the "Andreas Hofer Lied/ also known as "Zu Mantua in Banden/' which is actually the poem "Der Sandwirth Hofer, by Julius Mosen, set to a traditional folk tune. (Beethoven used the folk tune in the final rondo of his Piano Concerto No. 1.) Andreas Hofer (17671810) was the leader of the 1809 Tyrolese rebellion against Bavarian rule and Napoleon's forces. The French captured him, took him to Mantua, in Italy, and executed him. The /zHofer Lied〃 is the Tyrolese anthem.

§209. Intellectuals. Traditional intellectuals

It is more likely, however, that this note was prompted by a review of the French translation of Castiglioni's book: René A. Gutmann, /zLa médecine et les livres: Uhistoire de la médecine de A. Cas-tiglioni,〃 Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 474 (November 14, 1931).

For an English translation, see Arturo Castiglioni, A History of Medicine, 2nd ed.z trans. E.B. Krumbhaar (New York: Knopf, 1958).

I. Gramsci probably extracted the information on Louis Halphen's Les universités au XHIe siècle (Paris: Alcan, 1931) from the "Semaine bibli-ographique〃 section of Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 473 (November 7/ T93i).

§2ii. Intellectuals. The academies
i. The number of Italian academies in the eighteenth century is mentioned in a note in a report from Italy by Léon Kochnitzky, "Le laurier toujours vert: La semaine de Petrarque à Arezzo/' Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 473 (November 7, 1931)・

NOTEBOOK 7 II93O-3 I )
DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT

A ruled school notebook (14.7 x 19.8 cm) with hard black covers and a gray spine. A label on the front cover carries the imprint of the stationer: "Gius. Laterza e figli, Bari." Inside the blank space of the label, Gramsci's prison number (7047) is written in blue pencil. After Gramsci's death, Tatiana Schucht glued another label on the upper right-hand corner of the front cover； on it, she wrote: ^Completo da pg. 2 a 76. VII” (Complete from p. 2 to 76. VII). The Roman numerals indicate the number Tatiana Schucht assigned the notebook according to a cataloging system she had devised when organizing Gramsci's papers soon after his death. This notebook has the same physical characteristics as Notebooks 3, 5, and 6.

The notebook consists of seventy-six leaves with twenty-one lines on each side and unlined endpapers in front and back. The recto side of each leaf is numbered ( 1-74) in green ink. An error evidently occurred in the original numbering of the pages； the leaves between pp. 31-32 and pp. 69-70 were skipped but subsequently numbered 31a and 69a in a different hand and different ink. The recto side of each leaf is stamped with the prison seal: "Casa penale speciale di Turi” (Special Prison of Turi). The back endpaper is also numbered (75) and stamped with the prison seal on the recto side. All pages of the notebook are used, except for the following: p. 1 (entirely blank on both recto and verso), p. 73V (bottom five lines are blank), and p. 74V (entirely blank).

The notebook contains 108 notes or sections. Of these, 21 are crossed out, but they remain perfectly legible, and all of them were later incorporated by Gramsci in other notebooks； following Valentino Gerratana^s denomination these are called A texts. The other 87 notes, called B texts, were neither crossed out nor used again in other notebooks.

Almost half the pages of this notebook—specifically pp. 2r to 34V—were used by Gramsci for exercises in translation. He translated almost the entire contents of a small volume of selections from the writings of Karl Marx (edited by E. Drahn), Lohnarbeit und Kapital: Zur Judenfrage und andere Schriften aus der Frühzeit, 2d ed. (Leipzig: Ph. Reclam, n.d.； Reclams Universal Bibliothek, nos. 6068, 6069). The following is a list of the passages translated by Gramsci in the same order (and with the same underlined headings, italicized here) as they appear in the notebook； this arrangement is different from that of the German anthology:

pp. 2r-3r:

1. Ludwig Feuerbach. This is the text of Karl Marx's "Theses on Feuerbach^ in the version that was published by Frederick Engels as an appendix to his Ludwig Feuerbach and the Outcome of Classical German Philosophy (1888).

pp. 3—4r:

2. Il materialismo storico (Historical materialism). This comprises the middle paragraphs of Marx's preface to his Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy [18S9}-

pp. 4S10V：

3. Teoria della storia (Theory of history). The first section, "Bourgeois and Proletarians/7 of The Communist Manifesto (1848) is translated in its entirety here.

pp. IOV-IIV：

4. Esigenze della politica tedesca prima del 1848 (Exigencies of German politics before 1848). This consists of the complete text of Demands of the Communist Party in Germany, the leaflet by Marx and Engels that was published in Cologne in 1848.

pp. i2r-2/r:

5. Salario e capitale (Wages and capital). Gramsci prefaces his translation of this selection with a brief notation: "Originated as a lecture in Brussels in 1847 and later published in Neue Rheinische Zeitung.f/ The text that Gramsci translates is, in fact, Marx's article ^Lohnarbeit und Kapital" ("Wage Labour and Capital"), which appeared in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung of April 5, 1849.

pp. 27T-29V：

6. Sulla questione degli ebrei (On the Jewish question). As is obvious from Gramsci's rubric, this is an extract from Marx's On the Jewish Question (1844).

pp. 29V-32V：

7. Il materialismo francese del i8° secolo (Eighteenth-century French materialism). Here Gramsci translates all but a few paragraphs of subsection D ("Critical Battle Against French Materialism") of part 3 (^Absolute Criticism's Third Campaign") of chapter 6 Absolute Critical Criticism") of Marx and Engels's The Holy Family (1844).

PP- 32v—33r:

8. Sv Goethe (On Goethe). Between 1846 and 1847/ Engels wrote two essays under the common title "German Socialism in Verse and Prose.” The discussion in the first essay centers on a book by Karl Beck, Lieder vom armen Mann (1845)； the second essay deals with Karl Grün's book Über Göthe vom menschlichen Standpunkte (1846). The essays were published in segments between September and December 1847 by the Deutsche-Briisseler-Zeitung. The extract translated by Gramsci is from the second essay, specifically from the segment published on November 28, 1847. The editor of the anthology from which Gramsci translated this extract erroneously attributed its authorship to Marx. Thus when Gramsci refers to this same text in Notebook 8, §214, he wrongly assumes it is by Marx.

P- 33V：

9. Il suonatore (The musician). This is a prose translation of Marx's poem "Der Spielman" (1837).

PP- 33v-34V：

10. Lettera a suo padre (A letter to his father). This is a partial translation of Marx's letter of November 10, 1837, to his father.

The notebook also contains other materials not included in the main text of this edition. On p. 74^ Gramsci made a list of periodicals； they are the same periodicals itemized in Gramsci's draft of the petition he sent to "HE. the Head of Governmentin October 1931. (See Notebook 2, "Description of the Manuscript/7 1:52728). In this list, the items are numbered； some of the titles are un-derlinedz but most are not； and the numbers of certain items are preceded by a sign, in some cases an "x〃 and in other cases (all of them foreign publications) a square bracket. The list is reproduced here as it appears in the manuscript:

On the recto of the back endpaper (which in the manuscript is numbered "75") Gramsci jotted some very brief notes that are followed by a series of bibliographical items. They are reproduced below as they appear in the manuscript (i.e., with Gramsci's numbering, which precedes all but the last three items separated from the other entries by a straight line):

i° question of the disallowed books

2。question of the study on Croce's philosophy of the practical

30 question of the reading of the daily newspapers

40 conditions of isolation； same means of control as in Milan

50 reference books: atlas, yearbook of commercial bank, League of Nations yearbook, Mortara's Prospettive〈economiche〉 i° Le procès du Parti industriel de Moscou—an abridged report, pref, by Pierre Dominique.

4° Grinko, Le plan quinquennal

5° Yakovlev, Les exploitations collectives et Fessor de Fagricolture

6° Trotsky, La Révolution défigurée

7° ibid., Vers le capitalisme ou vers le socialisme?

Several pieces of external and internal information are germane to the dating of the material in this notebook. In a letter dated March 24, 1930, Gramsci asked Tatiana Schucht to write to the bookstorefor a copy of Lohnarbeit und Kapital, the anthology from which he translated passages from Marx's writings. Later, in a June i, 1931, letter to his wife, Julia, Gramsci wrote: "Aesthetic admiration can be accompanied by a certain 'civic' contempt, as in the case of Marx's attitude towards Goethe." When writing this, Gramsci was evidently thinking of the passage on Goethe he had translated (perhaps around the same time) from the Marx anthology. (As noted above, the editor of the anthology erroneously attributed the text on Goethe to Marx, whereas it was really Engels's.)

Since the first set of "Notes on Philosophy" in Notebook 4 were completed by the end of October or early November 1930, there is every reason to believe that the "Second Series," for which Gramsci set aside a substantial segment of this notebook, was started immediately or shortly thereafter. In §41, Gramsci refers to an article that was published in March 1931, so there can be no doubt that the last eight "Notes on Philosophy" were written after that date. Also, it is all but certain that §44 was written after July 26, 1931 (see the Notes to the Text). Furthermore, in §47, Gramsci explicitly refers to a book that he received at the prison in Turi on August 31, 1931.

Gramsci started using the available empty pages of this notebook for miscellaneous notes in August 1931 or immediately thereafter. In §49 (page 35 V in the manuscript), he writes: /zRecently (August 1931), I read . . Furthermore, §70, §75, §84, and §100 cite articles that appeared in print in December 1931. Also, in §98, Gramsci alludes to notes he had written in Notebook 6, specifically §183 and §188.

In L'officina gramsciana: Ipotesi sulla struttura dei aQuaderni del carcere" (Naples: Bibliopolis, 1984), p. 142, Gianni Francioni offers the following chronology of the composition of Notebook 7:

§§   1-11: November 1930

12-17: between November and December 1930

18-22: between November-December 1930 and February 1931

23-32: February 1931

33-48: between February and November 1931

49-54： August 1931

55-59: between August and October 1931

60-68: October 1931

69: between October and December 1931

70-108: December 1931

NOTES TO THE TEXT

Notes on Philosophy. Materialism and Idealism. Second Series

§i. Benedetto Croce and historical materialism
1. Gramsci is referring to the pagination of his manuscript； see Notebook 7, §8.

2. See "Il congresso di Oxford” (The congress at Oxford) in the ^Commenti e schermaglie” (Comments and skirmishes) section of La nuova Italia I, no. io (October 20, 1930): 431-32. This short, unsigned article about the Seventh International Congress of Philosophy held in Oxford on September 1-5, 1930, also quotes a passage from a letter by "one of the participants〃何Imost certainly Croce himself) on Croce's intervention in the section on aesthetics, in which he expressed his disagreement with Anatoly Lunacharsky of the Soviet Union. The unnamed author of the letter wrote, among other things:

I would like to make an additional remark to Mr. Lunacharsky: contrary to his belief that historical materialism is a rigorously antimetaphysical and totally realist conception, this theory is theological even more than it is metaphysical because it divides the oneness of the process of the real into structure and superstructure, noumenon and phenomenon, and for its basis it has, as a noumenon, a hidden God, the Economy, that pulls all the strings and is the only reality behind the appearances of morality, religion, philosophy, art, and so on. (p. 432)

Gramsci wrote at length on this short article in a letter to Tatiana Schucht on December 1, 1930, where he made many of the same points he makes in this note:

I would be glad if in some bookstore in Rome you could find the October issue of the magazine La Nuova Italia directed by Professor Russo and if you could send it to Giulia. In it is published a letter about the courteous debate that took place at the International Congress of Philosophers recently held in Oxford between Benedetto Croce and Lunacharsky with regard to the question of whether there exists or can exist an aesthetic doctrine of historical materialism. This letter is perhaps by Croce himself, or at least by one of his disciples, and it is strange.

It seems that Croce answered a dissertation by Lunacharsky, adopting a certain paternal tone, part protective and part humorous banter, to the congress's great amusement. From the letter, it also appears that Lunacharsky did not know that Croce had given a lot of thought to historical materialism, has written much about it, and is in any case deeply versed in the entire subject, and this seems strange to me, because Croce's books are translated into Russian, and Lunacharsky knows Italian very well.

From this letter, it also appears that Croce's position on historical materialism marks a return to the old . . . medieval theologism, to pre-Kantian and pre-Cartesian philosophy. A most extraordinary thing that makes one suspect that he, too, despite his Olympian serenity, is beginning to doze off too often, more often than happened to Homer. I don't know if he will write a special account of this subject； it would be very interesting, and I think it would not be difficult to answer him, drawing the necessary and sufficient arguments from his own works. I believe that Croce has had recourse to a very transparent polemical sleight of hand and that his opinion, rather than a philosophic-historical opinion, is only an act of will, that is, it has a practical purpose. That many so-called theoreticians of historical materialism might have fallen into a philosophical position similar to medieval theologism and might have made of "economic structure" a sort of "unknown god〃 can perhaps be proven, but what would it mean? It would be as though one were trying to judge the religion of the Pope and the Jesuits and were to talk about the superstitions of the peasants of Bergamo. Croce's position on historical materialism seems to me similar to the position of Renaissance men on Lutheran Reform: "Where Luther enters, civilization disappears,f, said Erasmus, and yet the historians and Croce himself today recognize that Luther and the Reformation stand at the beginning of all modern philosophy and civilization, Croce's philosophy included. The men of the Renaissance did not understand that a great movement of moral and intellectual renewal, inasmuch as it was embodied by the vast popular masses, as happened with Lutheranism, would at first assume coarse and even superstitious forms and that this was inevitable due to the very fact that the German people, and not a small aristocracy of great intellectuals, was the protagonist and the standard-bearer of the Reformation. If Giulia can do it, she ought to let me know whether the Croce-Lunacharsky polemic will give rise to intellectual manifestations of some importance. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 1:364-65)

Anatoly Lunacharsky (1875-1933), a Bolshevik revolutionary and a member of the party from its earliest days, studied in Switzerland and had a special interest in literature and the arts. He played a major role in safeguarding Russia's cultural treasures during the revolution. Lunacharsky was commissar of education from 1917 until 1929.

At the International Congress of Philosophy held in Oxford in 1930, Croce delivered a paper entitled "Antistoricismo” (Antihistoricism). He published this paper in a booklet together with another paper (/zPunti di orientamento della filosofìa moderna" [Points of orientation of modern philosophy]) he had delivered at the International Congress of Philosophy of 1926 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. See B. Croce, Punti di orientamento della filosofia moderna: Antistoria (Bari: Laterza, 1931). Gramsci asked for this booklet to be sent to him in his letter of January 25/ 1932, to Tatiana Schucht.

3. Gramsci is referring to the praise lavished on Henri De Man's Au delà du Marxisme (Brussels: Églantine, 1927) in a review of the book by Benedetto Croce in La critica 26, no. 6 (November 20, 1928): 459-60. On this book and on Henri De Man, see Notebook i, §61, n. 13, and §132/ n. 4.

4. See Notebook 4, §44, where Gramsci quotes SoreFs comments on Clemenceau at length.

5. In Notebook 4, §3, Gramsci transcribed a passage from Benedetto Croce's Storia delPetà barocca in Italia (1929) that quotes Erasmus: 〃Ubi・ cumque regnat lutheranismus, ibi litterarum est interitus.,z

6. Gramsci is paraphrasing a Crocean position that is expounded most clearly in Storia d'Europa nel secolo decimonono (Bari: Laterza, 1932). In the Italian edition, the relevant passage is on pp. 31-32； it is quoted here from the English translation of the work:

The Catholic conception and the doctrines that set it forth in a system and defended it with arguments, were not, in the ideal sphere, an opposition likely to trouble liberalism. The surest proof of this lay in the renunciation it made of, and even in the repugnance it felt towards, the continuance of the warfare that had been waged during the preceding centuries with arms and writing—particularly by Voltaire and the Encyclopedists； the harvest of that had been reaped. But for that very reason it would have been as unbecoming as it was superfluous to persist in it； the rest would be le任 to the play of time. And more than unbecoming, it would have been vulgar and inhuman, because (Voltaire and his followers had overlooked this) the old faith was still a way, a mythological one if you will, to soothe and calm suffering and sorrows and to solve the painful problem of life and death, and it was not to be rooted out with violence or insulted with mockery. And it would not be very politic, either, because those beliefs and the consolation derived from them and their teachings were the basis, for many men, of the formula and the authority of social duties, and gave rise to foundations and institutions of social welfare and charity, and the motives of order and discipline—all forces and capacities to be assimilated and transformed gradually, but not to be struck down without knowing what to set in their places or without replacing them at all. (Benedetto Croce, History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century, trans. Henry Furst [New York: Harcourt Brace, 1933], pp. 24—25)

7. Giovanni Gentile's reform of education made religious instruction compulsory at the elementary school level. See Notebook 4, §53, n. 6/ and §55, nn. 1-3.

8. Benedetto Croce was minister of education in 1920-1921 in the government of Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti.

9. See Benedetto Croce怎 short essay /zReligione e serenità/z (Religion and peace of mind), in which he argues against the assumption that peace of mind can only be attained through religious faith. This is how the essay opens:

It is customary to assert that religion provides a kind of consolation and serenity that no philosophy can give. On considering the facts, however, I would not dare say that this is indeed the case. I look around me, or I collect my memories of religious men (by which I mean simply believers in a specific religion) with whom I have lived or whom I have come across, and I do not find them to be any more serene or any less troubled than the nonreligious persons (nonbelievers) whom I have also known. The manifestations of joy and of sorrow are the same in the ones as in the others.

This essay was first published in La critica 13, no. 2 (March 20, 1915): 153-55. It was later included in the first section, "Frammenti di etica" (Fragments on ethics), of Croce's Etica e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1931)； see pp. 23-25. Gramsci had a copy of Etica e politica at Turi, but his familiarity with and admiration of the essay /zReligione e serenità" goes back to at least 1917. That year, Gramsci published the single issue (February n, 1917) of the publication he called La città futura, and in it he reprinted a slightly shortened version of Croce's essay. He reprinted the same shortened version again, under the title "La vanità della religione” (The vanity of religion), in L'ordine nuovo 2, no. 10 (July 17, 1920): 76. In his letter of August 17, 1931, to Tatiana Schucht, Gramsci alludes to the motivation of the essay (and the reason he admired it), but he does not refer to it explicitly by title:

When I was Cosmo's student, I did not agree with him on many things.... But it seemed to me that both myself and Cosmo, like many other intellectuals of the time (that is to say, during the first fifteen years of the century), found ourselves on a common ground that was as follows: we felt we were participating wholly or in part in the movement of moral and intellectual reform initiated in Italy by Benedetto Croce, whose first point was this, that modern man can and must live without religion, and that means without religion, revealed, positive, mythological, or whatever else you may want to call it. The point seems to me even today the major contribution to world culture made by modern Italian intellectuals, I regard it as a civil achievement that must not be lost.

13. Gramsci is referring to a book that is central to his critique of Croce's interpretations of Marxz a copy of which he had in Turi: Benedetto Croce, Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica, 4th ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1921). This book was first published in 1899. For an English translation, see Historical Materialism and the Economics of Karl Marx (London: Allen and Unwin, 1914)； this, however, is missing the second chapter of the Italian original.

14. The reference here is to Benedetto Croce怎 Elementi di politica (Bari: Laterza, 1929). This book was later reprinted as the second half of Etica e politica. The following passage is from the English translation of Elementi di politica:

Inasmuch as I was among the first to recommend the study of the concepts of historical materialism, which seemed to me quite effective for awakening the lazy philological historiography of the scholars of that time and for bringing it from words to facts, I wanted also to be among the first to recommend that we rid ourselves of its residual prejudices. This was all the more natural to me because I was on my guard against the supposed metaphysicists and naturalists of that doctrine, and advised that its dictates be treated as simple empirical rules of research. (Benedetto Croce, Politics and Morals, trans. S. Castiglione [New York: Philosophical Library, 1945], P- 96)

15. Benedetto Croce, Storia della storiografìa italiana nel secolo deci-monono, 2 vols. (Bari: Laterza, 1921). This work by Croce on nineteenthcentury Italian historiography is not preserved among Gramsci's books, but the textual references to it in different notebooks (especially in Notebook 9, §106) indicate that he did have a copy of it during the Turi period.

16. In Elementi di politica (pp. 91-92), Croce wrote, “A kind of dialectics did follow ... naturalism, but it happened to be in the form of historical materialism, which considered economic life a reality and moral life an appearance, an illusion or a "superstructure,z as it was called,/ (Croce, Politics and Moralsf p. 95.) On this, see also Notebook 4, §15, and n. 3 there.

17. Gramsci is alluding to the argument against Lunacharsky in the letter (which he correctly presumed to be by Croce) quoted in the Nuova Italia article that he mentions at the very beginning of this note.

18. In the third of his Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx writes: "The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of other circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated(K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 5, 1845—1847 [New York: International Publishers, 1975], P- 7).

19. See Notebook 4, §56, n. 3.

§2. Translatability of scienti ft c and philosophical languages
1. At the Third Congress of the Third International, held in June and July 1921, one of the main topics of discussion was the structure and organization of the national political parties. For the pertinent formal document, see "The Organizational Structure of the Communist Parties, the Methods and Content of their Work: Theses/7 in Theses, Resolutions, and Manifestos of the First Four Congresses of the Third International, ed. Alan Adler, trans. A. Holt and B. Holland (London: Pluto, 1983), pp. 234—61.

2. 〃Vilici〃 was Lenin.

3. In his report of November 13, 1922, to the Fourth Congress of the Communist International (which Gramsci attended), Lenin criticized the Third Congress's resolution on party organization for being "too Russian":

At the Third Congress, in 1921, we adopted a resolution on the organizational structure of the Communist parties and on the methods and content of their activities. The resolution is an excellent one, but it is almost entirely Russian, that is to say, everything in it is based on Russian conditions. This is its good point, but it is also its failing. It is its failing because I am sure that no foreigner can read it. I have read it again before saying this. In the first place, it is too long, containing fifty or more points. Foreigners are not usually able to read such things. Secondly, even if they read it, they will not understand it because it is too Russian. Not because it is written in Russian—it has been excellently translated into all languages—but because it is thoroughly imbued with the Russian spirit. And, thirdly, if by way of exception some foreigner does understand it, he cannot carry it out. This is its third defect. ... As I have said already, the resolution is excellently drafted； I am prepared to subscribe to every one of its fifty or more points. But we have not learned how to present our Russian experience to foreigners. All that was said in the resolution has remained a dead letter. If we do not realize this, we shall be unable to move ahead. (V.I. Lenin, Collected Works, vol. 33, August 1921-March 1923 [London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1966], p. 430)

§3. Philosophical and scientific Esperanto^
i. Volapük is an artificial language created around 1880 by a Catholic priest from Germany, Johann Martin Schleyer, that was meant to serve as an international medium of communication. By the turn of the century, it had been almost completely overshadowed by Esperanto.

More than once in his journalistic writings, Gramsci poured scorn on Esperanto and those who sought to promote it. See Notebook 3, §73, n. 4, and §76, n. 3.

2・ It is very unlikely that Gramsci had access to a copy of Mario Govi's book on methodology, Fondazione della metodologia: Logica ed epistemologia (Turin: Bocca, 1929). He derived information about it from articles and reviews in periodicals. One review he probably read is Renato Dambrosio's in Nuova rivista storica 15, no. 1-2 (January-April 1932): 206. Gramsci mentions this book again in §86 of this notebook. He also brings it up again in Notebook 8/ §184, and in that instance his source is an article, "Metodologia o agnosticismo?z/ (Methodology or agnosticism?), in La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 4 (November 15, 1930): 331-43.

3. On the Popular Manual, see Notebook i, §153, n. 3.

2. For the pertinent quote from Sorel, see Notebook 4, §3, n. 6.

§9. B. Croce and ethico-political history
1. In Cultura e vita morale, 2d cd. (Bari: Laterza, 1926), Croce wrote:

The point is to find where the real state truly is in the actual world and in a given historical moment； where the ethical force is really to be found. Though the state is concrete ethicality, it does not necessarily follow that this ethicality is embodied in the government, the sovereign, the ministers, the houses of parliament； it may be embodied in those who do not directly participate in the government, by the enemies and adversaries of a particular state, by revolutionaries. The idea of the state, precisely because it is an idea, is extremely unstable； the effort to enclose it in this or that institution, or in an ensemble of institutions, runs the risk of getting hold only of its shadow or its actual negation. When addressing the practical issue, abstract or generic speculative research must transform itself into specific and historical research, and it must delve into the contingent. It is not unusual for a man of thought facing empirical states to exclaim: LfÉtat cfest moi； and he may even be totally right. That is what Tommaso Campanella exclaimed (though in his case he was not quite right) when he contrasted the sovereigns of his time with himself and with the new type of sovereigns he envisaged: 〃Sham princes, as opposed to true, armed princes.” (pp. 24-25)

2. See Benedetto Croce, Storia del regno di Napoli (Bari: Laterza, 1926)； and Storia d'Italia dal 1871 al 1915, 3d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1928), of which Gramsci had a copy in Turi. Both works have been translated into English: History of the Kingdom of Naples, ed. H. Stuart Hughes, trans. F. Frenayc (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970)； A History of Italy, 18711915/ trans. C.M. Ady (New York: Russell and Russell, 1963).

§10. Structure and superstructure
1. See the "Notes on Philosophy. Materialism and Idealism. First Se-ries〃 in Notebook 4. See, especially, §§i2z 38/ and 45.

2. Gramsci is referring to Rosa Luxemburg's famous booklet on the general strike, which was originally published in German as Massenstreik: Partei und Gewerkschaften (1906). Gramsci read the Italian translation (which was made from the French version), Lo sciopero generale: Il partito e i sindacati, with a preface by Cesare Alessandri (Milan: Avanti! 1919). For an English translation, see The Mass Strike: The Political Party and the Trade Unions (New York: Harper and Row, 1971).

3. Although he was initially barred from having it (see the letter of August 25, 1930； to his brother Carlo), Gramsci was eventually able to read the Italian translation of a novel by Krasnov (first published in Russian in Berlin in 1921): P.N. Krasnoff； DalPaquila imperiale alla bandiera rossa (Florence: Salani, 1929). For an English translation, see P.N. Krasnov, From Double Eagle to Red Flag, 2 vols. (New York: Duffield, 1926).

Peter Nikolaevich Krasnov (1869-1947)； a Cossack, was a high-ranking officer in the Russian Imperial Army and a leader of the forces that supported Kerensky. Though captured when he sought to drive the Bolsheviks out of Petrograd, he was released and before long rejoined the armed effort to reverse the October Revolution. In the civil war； Krasnov commanded the anti-Bolshevik White Army, but in 1919, following a serious military setback； he left the country and moved to Germany. A Nazi collaborator, he was returned to the Soviet Union after the war and executed.

4. Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith provide the historical context:

The Red Army under Tukhachevsky was halted at the gates of Warsaw in August 1920, in its counter-offensive following Pilsudski's invasion of the Soviet Union. The defeat was followed by controversy both concerning the viability o£ the entire attempt to export revolution" without the support of the local population, and concerning the specific responsibilities for the defeat (Budyenny and Egorov, supported by Stalin, had not followed the orders of S. Kamenev, the commander-in-chief, and had marched on Lvov instead of linking up with Tukhachevsky before Warsaw). (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. Q. Hoare and G.

§11. A judgment on Gentile怎"actual idealism "
i. Bruno Revel, 〃I1 VII Congresso di filosofìa (The seventh Congress of Philosophy), L'Italia letteraria 2, no. 47 (November 23, 1930).

The Seventh National Congress of Philosophy, held in Rome in May 1929/ was presided over by Giovanni Gentile. One of the highlights of the congress was a polemic between the Franciscan priest Agostino Gemelli, a Thomist, and Giovanni Gentile. At one point, Gemelli stated: "No philosophical system negates the Christian foundation of life as thoroughly as idealism.〃(On Agostino Gemelli, see Notebook 4, §53, n. 7.) The proceedings of the congress were published in Atti del VII Congresso Nazionale di Filosofìa, Roma, 26-29 Maggio 1929 (Milan: Bestetti e Tuminelli, 1929).

On Giovanni Gentile, see Notebook 1, §15, n. 1.

3. The quotation is from a review-article by Giovanni Faccioli, 〃I1 volto del bolscevismo(The face of Bolshevism), Ultalia letteraria 2, no. 35 (August 31, 1930). The review-article is about René Fülöp-Miller's book that appeared in Italian translation under the same title, Il volto del bolscevismo, Faccioli reiterates some of Fülöp-Miller^ main points almost verbatim, and Gramsci's entire note is prompted by the topics touched on by Faccioli. Fülbp-Miller怎 book was of special interest to Gramsci； see Notebook 6/ §133/ n. 2.

§13. Einaudi and historical materialism
1. On Luigi Einaudi, see Notebook i, §n, n. 1.

2. See Benedetto Croce, Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica, 4th ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1921), a copy of which Gramsci had in Turi. This book has been translated into English as Historical Materialism and the Economics of Karl Marx (London: Allen and Unwin, 1914), but without chapter 2/ 〃Le teorie storiche del Prof. Loria” (Professor Loria's theories of history).

3. See Notebook 1, §11.

4. On Achille Loria, see Notebook i, §25, n. 1,

Luigi Einaudi edited La riforma sociale from 1900 to 1935.

5. Gramsci does not remember the title precisely, but there can be little doubt which article of Loria's he is referring to. See Achille Loria, "Documenti ulteriori a suffragio delFeconomismo storico” (Additional documents in support of historical economism), La riforma sociale 36, nos. 9-10 (September-October 1929): 409-48.

6. See Luigi Einaudi, 〃I1 mito dello strumento tecnico ed i fattori umani del movimento operaio” (The myth of the technical instrument and the human aspects of the workers' movement), La riforma sociale 37, no. 6 (November-December 1930): 579-89. Einaudi's article discusses Rinaldo Rigola's autobiography, Rigola e il movimento operaio nel biellese: Autobiografìa. Saggio sulla storia del movimento operaio (Bari: Laterza, 1930). Gramsci had a copy of this book in Turi.

Rinaldo Rigola (1868-1954), born in the town of Biella in Piedmont, was a founder of the Confederazione Generale del Lavoro (CGL), the national labor union established in Milan in 1906. Its major and most powerful constituents were the industrial workers of the north, but it also represented agricultural workers. Though it had a rather close relationship with the Socialist Party, the CGL remained autonomous, and Rigola, who remained its secretary-general until 1918, adopted a generally moderate course and was rather averse to confrontational politics. The CGL disbanded in 1927 in the aftermath of Fascist legislation that rendered labor unions impotent.

7. See Croce, Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica^ pp. 39-40. See also Notebook 4, §19, where Gramsci specifically discusses Croce's dismissal of Loria's concept of the "technical instrument."

8. Gramsci may have been thinking of two of Luigi Einaudi's books in particular: Prediche (Bari: Laterza, 1920) and Gli ideali di un economista (Florence: La Voce, 1921). Gramsci owned a copy of the latter volume, but he did not have it with him in prison.

9. Einaudi was one of the contributors to a set of tributes to Gobetti (who died in Paris in February 1926) published under the general title z/Piero Gobetti nelle memorie e nelle impressioni dei suoi maestri” (Gobetti remembered by his mentors) in II Baretti 3, no. 3 (March i6, 1926), a periodical that had been founded by Gobetti. In his contribution, Einaudi made a point of attributing (and thus of playing down) Gobetti's friendly relations with the communists and his sympathy with their struggle to his generous spirit and to the general social-political atmosphere of the times. The same point is made by Giuseppe Prato in his book on the socioeconomic effects of the war on Piedmont, Il Piemonte e gli effetti della guerra sulla sua vita economica e sociale, a publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Bari: Laterza； New Haven: Yale University Press, 1925)； see, in particular, p. 233. Gramsci read Prato's book when he was being held in prison in Milan (see his letter of May 23, 1927, to Tatiana Schucht).

Giuseppe Prato (1873-1928) coedited La riforma sociale with Luigi Einaudi from 1908 until he died.

On Piero Gobetti, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 29.

§14. Testimonies
i. Luigi Volpiceli] "Per la nuova storiografia italiana” (Fot the new Italian historiography), La fiera letteraria 4, no. 5 (January 29, 1928). The parenthetical asides and interjections are Gramsci's.

Luigi Volpicelli (1893-1993), like his brother, Arnaldo (mentioned elsewhere in the notebooks； see Notebook 4, §53, n. 5, and Notebook 6, §§12 and 82), was an ardent fascist and follower of Giovanni Gentile. He was especially interested in questions related to education and contributed to several fascist cultural periodicals in the 1930s and 1940s.

§15. The question of capitalism in antiquity and Barbagallo
i. See Corrado Barbagallo, Loro e il fuoco: Capitale e lavoro attraverso i secoli (Milan: Corbaccio, 1927). Gramsci read this book when he was imprisoned in Milan awaiting trial. See also Gramsci's comments on this book in Notebook 3, §112.

On Corrado Barbagallo, see Notebook i, §25, nn. 17 and 18. A letter from Gramsci to his wife, Julia Schucht, with a comment on Barbagallo is quoted in Notebook 2, §99, n. 2.

§16. War of position and war of maneuver, or frontal war
i. Gramsci is alluding to Leon Trotsky's theory of "permanent revolu-tion.〃 In suggesting that Trotsky's theory may be the political version of the military strategy of war of maneuver (i.e., frontal assault), he is returning to an issue he had already touched on in the final paragraph of §44 in Notebook 1 and in Notebook 6, §138. (See also Notebook i, §44, n. 53). The parallelism is debatable； in the view of Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, it is mistaken:

Paradoxically, in view of Gramsci's analogy here, in the military debate of 1920-21 Trotsky was the main opponent of war of maneuver, or the tactic of the revolutionary offensive, which was put forward by those civil war generals who supported the idea of a ^proletarian military sciencez,—Frunze, Budyenny and also Tukhachevsky. Moreover, he also delivered the main attack at the Third Comintern Congress on the "theory of the offensive,z in the political sphere； its main supporters were the PCI. . ., the Left in the German party, and Bela Kun. It should also perhaps be noted that the reference to Foch's unified command being a possible military equivalent of the /zunited front,z in politics was hardly a happy analogy, since Foch in fact had leanings towards Napoleonic offensive tactics, (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. Q. Hoare and G. Nowell Smith [New York: International, 1971L P. 23611)

In his own summarization of the theory of permanent revolution— which, he points out, originated in 1905—Trotsky explains that its central thesis pertained specifically to the stages of revolution in "backward bourgeois countries/7 He then goes on to write:

While the traditional view was that the road to the dictatorship of the proletariat led through a long period of democracy, the theory of the permanent revolution established the fact that for the backward countries the road to democracy passed through the dictatorship of the proletariat. Thus democracy is not a regime that remains self-sufficient for decades, but is only a direct prelude to the socialist revolution. Thus there is established between the democratic revolution and the socialist reconstruction of society a permanent state of revolutionary development.

The second aspect of the "permanent" theory has to do with the socialist revolution as such. For an indefinitely long time and in constant internal struggle, all social relations undergo transformation. Society keeps on changing its skin. Each stage of transformation stems directly from the preceding. The process necessarily retains a political character, that is, it develops through collisions among various groups in the society which is in transformation. Outbreaks of civil war and foreign wars alternate with periods of "peaceful" reform. Revolutions in economy, technique, science, the family, morals, and everyday life develop in complex reciprocal action and do not allow society to achieve equilibrium. Therein lies the permanent character of the socialist revolution as such.

The international character of the socialist revolution, which constitutes the third aspect of the theory of the permanent revolution, flows from the present state of the economy and the social structure of humanity. Internationalism is no abstract principle but a theoretical and political reflection of the character of the world economy, of the world development of productive forces, and the world scale of the class struggle. The socialist revolution begins on national foundations—but it cannot be completed within these foundations. ... In an isolated proletarian dictatorship, the internal and external contradictions grow inevitably along with the successes achieved. If it remains isolated, the proletarian state must finally fall victim to these contradictions. The way out for it lies only in the victory of the proletariat in advanced countries. Viewed from this standpoint, a national revolution is not a self-contained whole； it is only a link in the international chain. The international revolution constitutes a permanent process, despite temporary declines and ebbs. (Leon Trotsky, The Permanent Revolution and Results and Prospects |New York: Merit, 1969], pp. 132-33)

Commenting on this passage from Trotsky, Frank Rosengarten concludes that "the divergence between Trotsky and Gramsci lies in their understanding of how the national and international dimensions of the socialist revolution are to be interrelated with each other" ("The Gramsci-Trotsky Question (1922-1932),Social Text n [Winter 1984-1985]: 89). Indeed, insofar as Trotsky seems to be advocating a "frontal assault” (in the first of the three points he makes in this passage), he is clearly thinking specifically of the situation in "backward bourgeois countries.Gramsci's main criticism, on the other hand, stems from his conviction that "frontal assault" is the wrong strategy in the West一that is, in advanced liberal democracies. The rest of Trotsky's account of the theory of permanent revolution does not appear to contain anything that is significantly at odds with Gramsci's views.

Elsewhere, Gramsci also criticizes Trotsky for adopting a "military model" in dealing with the organization of labor and industry； see Notebook 4, §52.

On Krasnov, see Notebook 7/ §io, n. 3.

2. That is, Lenin.

3. In his autobiography, Trotsky wrote:

Writing afterward in the inexact and slovenly manner which is peculiar to him, Lunacharsky described my revolutionary concept as follows: ^Comrade Trotsky held in 1905 that the two revolutions (the bourgeois and socialist), although they do not coincide, are bound to each other in such a way that they make a permanent revolution. After they have entered upon the revolutionary period through a bourgeois political revolution, the Russian section of the world, along with the rest, will not be able to escape from this period until the Social Revolution has been completed. It cannot be denied that in formulating this view Comrade Trotsky showed great insight and vision, albeit he erred to the extent of fifteen years/7

The remark about my error of fifteen years does not become any more profound through its later repetition by Radek. All our estimates and slogans of 1905 were based on the assumption of a victorious revolution, and not of a defeat. We achieved then neither a republic nor a transfer of land, nor even an eight-hour day. Does it mean that we erred in putting these demands forward? The defeat of the revolution blanketed all prospects not merely those which I had been expounding. The question was not of the dates of revolution but of the analysis of its inner forces and of foreseeing its progress as a whole. (Leon Trotsky^ My Life [New York: Pathfinder, 1970], pp. 180-81)

Gramsci read the Italian translation of Trotsky's autobiography. La mia vita: Tentativo di autobiografìa, trans. E. Pocar (Milan: Mondadori, 1930), when he was in Turi. He went to great lengths to obtain permission to have the book； which was at first denied him； see Notebook 2, Description of the Manuscript.

4. From Guicciardini's Ricordi (C:i):

The pious say that faith can do great things, and, as the gospel says, even move mountains. The reason is that faith breeds obstinacy. To have faith means simply to believe firmly—to deem almost a certainty—things that are not reasonable； or, if they are reasonable, to believe them more firmly than reason warrants. A man of faith is stubborn in his beliefs； he goes his way, undaunted and resolute, disdaining hardship and danger, ready to suffer any extremity.

Now, since the affairs of the world are subject to chance and to a thousand and one different accidents, there are many ways in which the passage of time may bring unexpected help to those who persevere in their obstinacy. And since this obstinacy is the product of faith, it is then said that faith can do great things. (Francesco Guicciardini, Maxims and Reflections, trans. M. Domandi [Philadephia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972], p. 39)

5. The "united front" strategy was officially adopted by the Communist International at its Third Congress, in 1921. It called on all Communist parties to work with other entities such as trade unions as well as other parties in order to form a mass proletarian movement for the long-term struggle against capital. This official strategy was reaffirmed by the Fourth Congress of the Comintern. In the "Theses on the United Front/ adopted by the Executive Committee in December 1921, the "united front" strategy is defined unambiguously:

The united workers' front must mean the unity of all workers willing to fight against capitalism—including those workers who still follow the anarchists, syndicalists, etc. In the Latin countries there are still many such workers, and in other countries, too, they can contribute to the revolutionary struggle. From the start of its existence the Communist International has adopted a friendly line in its relations with those elements among the workers who have gradually overcome their prejudices and are moving towards Communism. Communists must be all the more attentive towards them now that the united workers7 front against the capitalists is becoming a reality. (Theses, Resolutions, and Manifestos of the First Four Congresses of the Third International, ed. Alan Adler, trans. A. Holt and B. Holland [London: Pluto, 1983], p. 408)

The official line adopted by the Comintern put the Italian Communist Party in an extremely difficult position, and most of its leaders, including Amadeo Bordiga (the most adamant of all) and Paimiro Togliatti, as well as Gramsci, opposed it； they could not envisage working alongside or in concert with the Socialist Party from which they had so recently (1921) broken away. That aspect of the problem was rendered moot when the Italian Socialist Party itself (in its 1923 national congress) excluded the possibility of fusing with the Communist Party. The Fascist seizure of power after the March on Rome in October 1922, accompanied by a wave of violence against all leftist groups and formations but especially against the Communists (not to mention Bordiga's arrest), further rendered the Italian situation unique. In the end, Gramsci chose to emphasize the need for adapting and formulating political strategy in keeping with each specific situation. Addressing a meeting of the Italian Communist Party's executive committee held on August 2-3, 1926 (just three months before his arrest), Gramsci asserted: z/Every capitalist country is faced with a fundamental problem: the problem of transition from the general idea of the united front tactic to a specific tactic that addresses the concrete problems of national life on the basis of the popular forces as they are historically determined." For the full text, see 〃Un esame della situazione italiana" (A study of the Italian situation), in Antonio Gramsci, La costruzione del partito Comunista (Turin: Einaudi, 1971), pp. 113-24； the quoted passage can be found on p. 123. An English translation (slightly di任erent from the one here) is provided in Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Political Writings: 1921-1926, ed. and trans. Quintin Hoare (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990), pp. 400-411； the comparable passage is on p. 410.

6. Ferdinand Foch (1851-1929) commanded the Allied forces in the final phase of World War I.

7. See Notebook 7, §10, n. 2.

8. In the course of his political and journalistic work in Turin, Gramsci kept himself informed of the activities of the French revolutionary syndicalists and read their periodical La vie ouvrière. His allusion to "Rosmer's articles on Germany,however, is vague and may have been based on a faulty memory, or else he means to refer to the articles that Alfred Rosmer published in his periodical. No articles by Rosmer on Germany have been located either in La vie ouvrière or elsewhere. Quite possibly, Gramsci may have been thinking about an article by Charles Andler, 〃Le zsocial-isme impérialiste7 et les ouvriers allemands/7 La vie ouvrière 5/ no. 86 (April 20, 1913): 449-54. Andler criticizes the German social democrats for not going as far as they could go in their opposition to the war； in his view, they should have joined in a call for a general strike.

The bimonthly La vie ouvrière first appeared in October 1905 and continued publication until July 1914； this run is what Gramsci is referring to as the zzfirst series.〃 Alfred Rosmer (the pseudonym of André Alfred Griot, 1877-1964) started participating in the work of the periodical in 1910, and before long he became, together with Pierre Monatte, one of the most prominent leaders of the syndicalists. La vie ouvrière resumed publication in 1919 with Rosmer and Monatte as editors until it ceased publication in 1921. A founding member of the French Communist Party in 1920, Rosmer was also elected to the Executive Committee of the Comintern, and he assumed the editorship of Uhumanité in 1923. Rosmer, a friend of Trotsky% was expelled from the party in 1924 for joining the opposition to Stalin.

2. See Notebook if §132, n. 1.

3. On January 15, 1922, Gentile delivered a speech inaugurating the Scuola di Cultura Sociale in Rome. The speech, "Lavoro e cultura” (Work and culture), was later included in Gentile's book Fascismo e cultura (Milan: Treves, 1928), pp. 16-37. Gramsci had a copy of this book in Turi.

§18. The unity in the component parts of Marxism
i. The title of this note seems to echo Lenin's "The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism” (1913), an Italian translation of which was published (probably at Gramsci's suggestion) in Uunità of October 24, 1925. The content of the note, however, bears little resemblance to the line of exposition developed by Lenin, who in the introductory section of his piece wrote: "Marxist doctrine . . . is comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defence of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the best that man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by German philosophy, English political economy and French socialism. It is these three sources of Marxism, which are also its component parts that we shall outline in brief,z (Collected Works, vol. 19/ 1913 [London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1966], p. 21).

§20. The Popular Manual

i. See Notebook 4, §38, n. 1.

§21. The validity of ideologies
i. In Capital (book i, part i, chap. 3), Marx wrote:

However, Aristotle himself was unable to extract this fact, that in the form of commodity-values, all labour is expressed as equal human labour and therefore as labour of equal quality, by inspection from the form of value, because Greek society was founded on the labour of slaves, hence had as its natural basis the inequality of men and of their labour-powers. The secret of the expression of value, namely the equality and equivalence of all kinds of labour because and in so far as they are human labour in general, could not be deciphered until the concept of human equality had already acquired the permanence of a fixed popular opinion. (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. trans. Ben Fowkes [London: Penguin, 1976], pp. 151-52)

Benedetto Croce also mentions this passage from Capital in a long footnote (on p. 32) in Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica^ 4th ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1921), a book that Gramsci had in Turi and that he mentions several times in the notebooks.

2. From Marx's "Contribution to the Critique of HegeFs Philosophy of Right: Introduction^ (1844): "The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism by weapons, material force must be overthrown by material force； but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses" (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 3, 18431844 [New York: International, 1975], p. 182). Gramsci would have read this passage in the French edition of Marx's works that he had in prison: Oeuvres philosophiques, trans. J. Molitor (Paris: Costes, 1927), 1:205.

4. Luigi Einaudi and Edoardo Giretti, 〃Le società anonime a catena” (Limited liability company linkages), Riforma sociale 38/ no. 42 (January-February, 1931): 78-106.

On Luigi Einaudi, see Notebook i, §n, n. 1.

Edoardo Giretti (1864-1940), an antiprotectionist liberal, wrote a number of books on trade and on the effects of tariffs. A harsh critic of Giolitti and a staunch pacifist who vigorously opposed the Libyan war, he was elected to parliament in 1913.

5. This observation is in Luigi Negro, “L'ultima replica al prof. Graziadei sulPaumento del salario nella teoria marxista,/ (Final response to Prof. Graziadei on the rise of wages in Marxist theory), Critica sociale 11, no. 16 (August 16/ 1901): 253-55. This was the last of a long list of articles and notes by the orthodox Marxist economist Negro against Graziadei, stretching back to 1897, which appeared in the following issues of Critica sociale: 7, no. 18 (September i6, 1897): 286； 8, no. 19 (November 16, 1899): 301-4； ii, no. 7 (April I, 1901): 108-9； il, no. 8 (April i6, 1901): 124-27； ii, no. 14 (July 16, 1901): 218-20.

§24. Structure and superstructure
1. All the works mentioned here are included in the French and Italian, editions and anthologies of the writings of Marx and Engels that Gramsci owned. Engels is the author of Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany, which consists of articles originally published in the New York Tribune (1851-52), but for a long time it was erroneously attributed to Marx.

2. On Ernest Bernheim's Lehrbuch der historischen Methode, 6th cd. (Leipzig: Dunker und Humblot, 1908), see Notebook 4, §5/ and n. 2 there.

3. The debate over the "procession of the Holy Spiritz/ is also known as the //filioque/, controversy. The Western or Latin version, of the Niccne Creed states: "I believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and Son.〃 The Byzantine Church never accepted the addition of the phrase "and Son." The issue dates back to the sixth century or even further back if one takes into account divergent theological currents in Trinitarian doctrine. The procession of the Holy Spirit was the doctrinal issue at the center of the dispute that resulted in the rupture between the Western and Eastern churches in the eleventh century.

4. 〃I1 dumping russo e il suo significato storico” (Russian dumping and its historical significance), a long, meandering text with ramblings on history and observations on historical materialism, was published in six segments in the periodical Problemi del lavoro. The segments appeared in the following issues: 4/ no. 11 (November i, 1930): 7-9； 4, no. 12 (December I, 1930): 8-10； 5/ no. I (January iz 1931): 8-11； 5/ no. 2 (February i, 1931): 7-10； 5, no. 3 (March i, 1931): 7-11； and 5, no. 4 (April i, 1931): 9-13. The periodical was the organ of the Associazione Nazionale Studi Problemi del Lavoro (National association for the study of labor problems), which was founded in 1927 by, among others, Rinaldo Rigola (see Notebook 7/ §巧, n. 7). The reformist trade unionist had by this time endorsed Fascism. Franz (or Francesco) Weiss was a regular contributor to the monthly.

§25. The objectivity of the real

2. See Benedetto Croce's polemic with Anatoly Lunacharsky described in Notebook 7, §i, n. 2.

§27. Graziadei and the land of Cocaigne
i. Gramsci did not have a copy of Giovanni Papini's Gog (Florence: Vai-lecchi, 1930). This quotation is transcribed from an article by Ettore Allodoli, "Gog e la civiltà” (Gog and civilization). Critica fascista 9, no. 4 (February 15, 1931): 78-79.

On Giovanni Papini, see Notebook 1, §8, n. 1.

Gramsci makes a connection (in the title of the note) between this quotation and Graziadei because Benedetto Croce had written of Graziadei that "if he supposed that the machines would produce automatically a superfluity of goods for the whole of that society, then he was simply constructing by hypothesis a land of Cocaigne." See Notebook 1, §63, n. 1.

§29. On the Popular Manual

i. This is an allusion to the third of Marx's Theses on Feuerbach (1854)； see Notebook 7, §i, n. 18.

§30. On Graziadei
1. See Antonio Graziadei's book on the industrial production of sodium nitrate in the late nineteenth century, Saggio di una indagine sui prezzi in regime di concorrenza e di sindacato tra gli imprenditori: Uindustria del nitrato sodico dal i° gennaio 1880 al 31 dicembre 1903 (Imola: Paolo Galeati, 1909).

2. Between November 1909 and February 1910, Il viandante published responses to an inquiry it conducted on the question of "socialist participation in government." In his response, published in II viandante 2/ no. 28 (December 12, 1909), Graziadei stated:

I do not believe, in any way, that the participation of socialist representatives in the government conflicts in any way with the spirit and the methods of class struggle, Class struggle and class cooperation are not totally incompatible terms； they are not always and in all fields mutually exclusive. They are, rather, complementary terms. On certain issues (for example, national defense, the increase in social wealth, etc.), one cannot think in any terms but class cooperation. On the other hand, there are issues (such as the distribution of wealth) that can only be thought of in terms of class struggle.

3・ See Antonio Graziadei, Socialismo e sindicalismo (Rome: Mongini, 1909). This is the text of a talk on socialism and trade unionism Graziadei gave at Imola on September 15, 1908.

4. See Notebook 1, §58, and n. 5 there.

5. As Derek Boothman explains: "This particular obbligato was a type of land tenure limited to the area around the town of Imola in what is now the region of Emilia Romagna； in return for a set number of days worked each year for the landowner, agricultural workers could build their houses on reclaimed land at favorable rates. By no stretch of the imagination could Graziadeizs 'generalization' therefore be considered well-grounded (Antonio Gramsci, Further Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. D. Boothman [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995], P. 546 n. 35).

6. See Notebook i, §48/ n. 2.

7. On Enrico Ferri, see Notebook 1, §25, n. 15； on Alfredo Niceforo, Notebook i, §44, n. 22； on Cesare Lombroso, Notebook 1, §26, n. 1.

Giuseppe Sergi (1841-1936), born in Messina, Sicily, was the first professor of anthropology (or the natural history of man, as the chair was then called) at the University of Rome, where he also founded an anthropological museum. Sergi, a positivist, became well known for his research and theories on the racial origins of the Mediterranean people. (See, for example, his book The Mediterranean Race: A Study of the Origin of European Peoples [London: W. Scott, 1914].) He later became interested in Native American physical anthropology.

8. "Filthy Southerners,/ is an effort to translate "Sudici/〃 a racist term used by anti-Southerners in Italy. "Nordici" means ^Northerners,n and 〃sudici〃 sounds as if it is its counterpart (people of the 〃sud,〃 or south) but in fact means "filthy."

§31. On literary criticism
1. Francesco De Sanctis's "La scienza e la vita” (Science and life) is collected with his other critical writings in the three-volume Saggi critici, ed. P. Arcari (Milan: Treves, 1924)； see vol. 3/ pp. 222-42. Gramsci received a copy of this work during the period of his imprisonment in Milan.

On Francesco De Sanctis, see Notebook 1, §96, n. 3.

2. See Luigi Russo, “La scienza e la vita，' Leonardo 4, no. 1 (January 20, 1928): 1-7.

On Luigi Russo, see Notebook 1, §35, n. 2.

3. When Luigi Russo's study on De Sanctis was first announced, its title was given as Francesco De Sanctis e lfUniversità di Napoli^ when it was actually published, however, it had a different title: Francesco De Sanctis e la cultura napoletana: 1860-1885 (Venice: La Nuova Italia, 1928).

§32. Henri De Man
1. Arturo Masoero, 〃Un americano non edonista” (A nonhedonist American), Economia 7/ no. 2 (February 1931): 151-72.

2. Gramsci had copies of two books by Henri De Man in Italian translation: La gioia del lavoro (Bari: Laterza, 1930) and II superamento del marxismo (Bari: Laterza, 1929). On these two works and on Henri De Man, see Notebook 1, §6i, n. 13.

3. "Instinct of workmanship,z is in English in Masoerozs article and in Gramsci's manuscript. The phrase appears in the title of one of Thorstein

Veblen's major essays: "The Instinct of Workmanship and the Irksomeness of Labor/7 American Journal of Sociology 4 (1898-99): 187-210,

4. Gramsci writes the phrase "instinct of constructivenessff in English (as it appears in Masoero's article), after giving its Italian equivalent, "istinto costruttivo.

5. Gramsci is referring to the following passage in Capital (book i, part 3, chap. 7)：

We presuppose labour in a form in which it is an exclusively human characteristic. A spider conducts operations which resemble those of the weaver, and a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax. At the end of every labour process, a result emerges which had already been conceived by the worker at the beginning, hence already existed ideally. Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature； he also realizes [verwirklicht] his own purpose in those materials, (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. i, trans. Ben Fowkes [London: Penguin, 1976], pp. 283-84)

This passage is quoted by Bukharin in the section z/Teleology in the Social Sciences" in the first chapter of Historical Materialism.

8. See Notebook 1, §132, n. 4.

9. Gramsci probably learned about this from an article by Massimo N. Fovel, “La nuova raccolta internazionale di economisti” (The new international collection of economists), Critica fascista 9, no. 3 (February i, 1931): 45-47. The article announced the publication plans for what would become the book series of works by Italian and foreign economists (Nuova collana di economisti stranieri e italiani) under the general editorship of Giuseppe Bottai and Celestino Arena. The initial plans projected the publication of some works by Thorstein Veblen； in the end, however, no Veblen volume was included in the series.

§33. Posing the issue
1. That is, Lenin's position.

2. Karl Radek's pamphlet (in Italian translation), devoluzione del socialismo dalla scienza alPazione: Gli ammaestramenti della Rivoluzione russa (The evolution of socialism from science to action: The lessons of the Russian revolution) was published in Milan in 1920 by Avanti! the publishing house of the Socialist Party. Gramsci had read this booklet at the time it was published, and he cited it in an article, "Soviet e consigli di fabbrica” (Soviets and factory councils), L'ordine nuovo 1, no. 43 (April 3-io, 1920): 340-45-

Karl Radek (1885-1939), a militant member of the Polish Social Democratic Party, moved to Germany to avoid arrest and subsequently to Switzerland, where he was close to Lenin. After the October Revolution, he devoted much of his energy to the work of the Communist International. Expelled from the party in 1927 for opposing Stalin, he recanted and was readmitted into the party, only to be arrested in 1937 and charged with treason.

3. "The German working class is the inheritor of German classical philosophy/7 This is the final sentence in Fredrick Engels's Ludwig Feuerbach und der Ausgang der klassichen deutschen Philosophie [Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy) (Stuttgart: J. H. W. Dietz, 1888).

On Graziadei, see Notebook 1, §42, n. 3.

6. Francesco Olgiati develops the comparison between Marx and Jesus in the final three pages of his book Carlo Marx (Milan: Vita e Pensiero,

1918) . The same publisher brought out a second edition of this book (which is cited by Gramsci in Notebook io, II, §41.i) in 1920. Gramsci had published a rather long review of Olgiati's book by Zino Zini, under the title "Marx nel pensiero di un cattolico” (Marx in the mind of a Catholic), in the weekly Grido del popolo 23, no. 736 (August 31, 1918). The same review was reprinted, without its original title, in the "Battaglia delle idee” (Battle of ideas) section of L'ordine nuovo 1, no. 18 (September 13,

1919) : 141—42. It is also included (on pp. 169-79) in Zino Zini, Poesia e verità (Milan: Corbaccio, 1926), a copy of which Gramsci had in Turi. Zini discusses the Marx-Jesus comparison in the concluding paragraphs of his review.

On Francesco Olgiati, see Notebook 4, §3, n. 3.

7. See Graziadei, Prezzo e sovraprezzo nell'economia capitalista, pp. 8-9.

§34. The tendential fall in the rate of profit
i. In this note, Gramsci is condensing some of the main points in Capital, book 3, part 3, entitled "The Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of ProfitZ7 The opening chapter of the section is "The Law Itself,n where Marx writes:

The same rate of surplus-value ... and an unchanged level of exploitation of labour, is expressed in a falling rate of profit, as the value of constant capital and hence the total capital grows with the constant capital's material volume.

If we further assume now that this gradual change in the composition of capital does not just characterize certain individual spheres of production, but occurs in more or less all spheres, or at least the decisive ones, and that it therefore involves changes in the average organic composition of the total capital belonging to a given society, then this gradual growth in the constant capital, in relation to the variable, must necessarily result in a gradual fall in the general rate of profit, given that the rate of surplus-value, or the level of exploitation of labour by capital, remains the same. . . . With the progressive decline in the variable capital in relation to the constant capital, this tendency leads to a rising organic composition of the total capital, and the direct result of this is that the rate of surplus-value, with the level of exploitation of labour remaining the same or even rising, is expressed in a steadily falling general rate of profit. (We shall show later on why this fall does not present itself in such an absolute form, but more in the tendency to a progressive fall.) (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. 3, trans. David Fernbach [London: Penguin, 1991], pp. 317-19)

In the chapter that immediately follows, Marx discusses the ^counteracting factors/7 or what Gramsci calls the "variables." The chapter is divided into six subsections, each of which deals with a different factor that can check or cancel the effect of the general law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit. The six factors treated by Marx are more intense exploitation of labor, reduction of wages below their value, cheapening of the elements of constant capital, the relative surplus population, foreign trade, and the increase in share capital (see Capital, 3:339-38).

§35. Materialism and historical materialism
1. Ludwig Feuerbach, "Das Geheimniss des Opfers oder Der Mensch ist, war er ißtz, (The mystery of sacrifice, or man is what he eats), Säm-mtliche Werke (Leipzig: Wigand, 1846-90), 10: 1-35. The epigrammatic "man is what he cats" recurred frequently in socialist writings, in part because it was taken to encapsulate the materialism Feuerbach supposedly espoused.

2. Gramsci is probably referring to some conversation he had with Amadeo Bordiga； the former leader of the Italian Communist party is not known to have written anything on the topic.

3. Massimo Bontempclli's defense of pasta against Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's denunciation of traditional Italian eating habits was brought up in a short unsigned article, "La pastasciutta, Dante e la storia d'Italia” (Pasta, Dante, and the history of Italy), Critica fascista 8, no. 23 (December io, 1930): 451. The article sided with Bontempelli.

On Marinetti and his antipasta "Manifesto of Futurist Cookery, see Notebook 6, §73, n. 2.

On Bontempelli, see Notebook 1, §136, n. 1.

4. Because of an error in the transcription of Gramsci's manuscript, the phrase "man is what he wears("l'uomo è il suo abbigliamentoz,) is missing from the Gerratana edition of the Quaderni del carcere.

5. George V. Plekhanov's Anarchism and Socialism (1895) was published in Italian translation as Anarchia e socialismo (Milan: Avanti!, 1921). That book, however, has little to say on the topic discussed here by Gramsci. A more pertinent work by Plekhanov is Fundamental Problems of Marxism, trans.

4. Gramsci alluded to these issues earlier in Notebook 4, §18 and §42. In this instance, he is thinking specifically of Vilfredo Pareto's distinction, in his Trattato di sociologia generale (Florence: Barbèra, 1923), between “the language of the logico-experimental and non-logico-experimental science and ordinary language/7 Pareto also maintained that insofar as the meaning of words is embedded in common usage, language is conducive to error. The following extract is taken from the abridged version (in English translation) of Pareto's voluminous treatise:

The terms of common speech are lacking in definiteness, and it cannot be otherwise, for precision goes only with scientific exactitude. Every argument based on sentiment, as all metaphysical arguments are, must of necessity use terms lacking in exactitude, since sentiments are indefinite and the name cannot be more definite than the thing. Such arguments actually rely on the lack of exactness in everyday language to mask their defects in logic and carry conviction. Logico-experimental arguments, being based instead on objective observation, tend to use words strictly to designate things and, therefore, to choose them in such a way as to avoid ambiguities and have terms as exact as possible. Moreover they equip themselves with a special, technical language and so escape the indefiniteness of common parlance....

Experimental science ... which envisages things exclusively； can, therefore, derive no advantage from words, but can incur great harm, whether because of the sentiment that words arouse, or because the existence of a word may lead one astray as to the reality of the things that it is supposed to represent, or finally, because reasonings based on words are as a rule woefully lacking in exactness....

To avoid the danger, ever threatening in the social sciences, that meanings of words will be persistently sought not in the objective definitions but in common usage and etymology, we would gladly have replaced word labels with letters of the alphabet, such as a, b, c ... or with ordinal numbers； and this, in fact, we shall do now and then....

In this volume I shall use . . . a number of terms that are also used in mechanics, and I shall accordingly explain to the reader the exact senses in which I use them. (Vilfredo Pareto, Compendium of General Sociology, ed. E. Abbott, trans. A. Bongiorno and A. Livingston [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1980], pp. 14-15)

For an integral English translation of Pareto's Trattato di sociologia generale, see The Mind and Society, ed. Arthur Livingston, trans. A. Bongiorno and A. Livingston (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935).

Pareto also discusses this issue in relation to pragmatist theory (and with specific reference to Giovanni Vailati) in his three-volume collection of writings I sistemi socialisti (Milan: Istituto Editoriale Italiano, 1918).

On Vilfredo Pareto, see Notebook 4, §i8, n. 6.

Apropos of the issue of language as a supposed source of error, Gramsci may have been thinking also of Giuseppe Prezzolimi work 11 linguaggio come causa terrore: H. Bergson (Florence: G. Spinelli, 1904).

§37. Goethe
l Gramsci came across this maxim of Goethe's in André Maurois, La vie de Disraeli (Paris: Gallimard, 1927), which quotes Goethe without providing a specific citation: "Comment un homme peut-il atteindre la connaissance de soi? Par la contemplation? Certainement non, mais par Faction. Essayez de faire votre devoir et vous trouvez pourquoi vous ètes fait. Mais quel est votre devoir? Ce que demande 1'heure" (p. 314).

Gramsci had a copy of Maurois's book, which has been translated into English as Disraeli: A Picture of the Victorian Age, trans. H. Miles (New York: Appleton, 1928),

The source is Goethe's ^Betrachtungen im Sinne der Wanderer77 (Reflections in the spirit of the wanderers), in Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (1821-1829): "Wie kann man sich selbst kennenlernen? Durch Betrachten niemals, wohl aber durch Handeln. 〃 For an English translation, see Goethe, Conversations of German refugees and Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years, ed. Jane K. Brown, trans. K. Winston (New York: Suhrkamp, 1983), especially p, 294.

§38. Examination of the concept of human nature
1. See Notebook 6, §82, and n. 16 there

2. Gramsci is referring to a passage in G.K. Chesterton's "The Invisible Man〃 in which Father Brown observes:

Have you ever noticed this—that people never answer what you say? They answer what you mean一or what they think you mean. Suppose one lady says to another, in a country house, “Is anybody staying with you?〃 the lady doesn't answer "Yes； the butler, the three footmen, the parlourmaid and so on,n though the parlourmaid may be in the room, or the butler behind her chair, She says, "There is nobody staying with us/ meaning nobody of the sort you mean. But suppose a doctor enquiring into an epidemic asks "Who is staying in the house?” then the ladywill remember the butler, the parlourmaid and the rest. All language is like that； you never get a question answered literally, even when you get it answered truly. (G.K. Chesterton, The Innocence of Father Brown [New York: John Lane, 1911], p. 143)

Gramsci probably read [/innocenza di padre Brown (Milan: Alpes, 1924), the Italian translation of The Innocence of Father Brown (1911), sometime before his imprisonment. He also had copies of two other works by Chesterton； see Notebook 3, §153/ n. 6, and Notebook 6/ §17, n. 2.

§39- Croce

1. Benedetto Croce, Cultura e vita morale, 2d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1926), p. 158. The passage occurs in a section entitled 〃La morte del socialismo” (The death of socialism), which is the text of an interview with Croce that was originally published under the same title in La voce 3, no. 6 (February 9, 1911): 501-2.

2. The chapter "Il partito come giudizio e come pregiudizio^ (The party as judgment and as prejudice) in Croce's Cultura e vita morale, pp. 191-98, was originally published as an article in Gaetano Salvemini's journal Unità X, no. 17 (April 6, 1912): 66.

3. In "I partiti politici” (The political parties), the third chapter of his little book Elementi di politica (Bari: Laterza, 1925), Croce wrote:

The parties are means offered to the various personalities so that they may fashion for themselves and, with themselves, their own ethical ideals, and so that they may make efforts to accomplish them. This accounts for the importance in the parties of heads and leaders and also of the others who seem to have positions of secondary importance and modestly withdraw to the shadows, yet manipulate the wires of action. The important thing, then, is the vigor of the personality, in whom the ethical ideal is embodied and expressed； it is usually admitted that political parties are what the individuals who form and personify them are. (Benedetto Croce, Politics and Morals, trans. S. Castiglione [New York: Philosophical Library, 1945], pp. 38-39)

Elementi di politica was later reprinted as the second half of Etica e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1931), of which Gramsci had a copy in Turi. On this topic, see also "Per una Società di cultura politica/7 a speech Croce delivered in May 1924 at the inauguration of a newly formed Society of Political Culture that was then reproduced as an appendix in Etica e politica, pp. 353-59.

§40. Nationalizations and state takeovers
i. All the information in this note about Manuel Saitzew's book on public enterprise, Die öffentliche Unternehmung der Gegenwart (Tübingen: Mohor, 1930), is derived from an unsigned book review in Economia 8, no. I (July 1931): 99-100.

§41. Economics
1. Henryk Grossmann's Des Akk um ula tions- und Zusammenbruchgesetz des kapitalistischen Systems (Zugleich eine Krientheorie) (Leipzig: C.L. Hirschfeld, 1929) was reviewed by Stefano Samogyi in Economia 7, no. 3 (March 1931): 327-32. For an abridged English translation of this book by Grossmann, see The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System: Being also a Theory of Chsesf trans. Jairus Banaji (London: Pluto, 1992).

2. On Gino Arias, see Notebook 6/ §66, n. 1.

3. It appears that Gramsci never obtained a copy of Grossmann's book. He does mention it again, however, in Notebook io, II, §33.

§42. Elliptical comparison^
1. In Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica, Croce asserted that Marx怎 theory of value was based on an "elliptical comparison." See Notebook I, §ioz n. 2.

2. See Antonio Graziadei, Sindacati e salari (Milan: Trevisini, 1929), p. 16.

On Graziadei and his books (the titles of which Gramsci sometimes confuses), see Notebook 1, §42, n. 3, and §63, n. 2.

For an English translation, see A History of Economic Doctrines from the Time of the Physiocrats to the Present Day, trans. R. Richards, 2d ed. (Boston: Heath, 1948).

4. See Benedetto Croce, "Le due scienze mondane: PEstetica e ^Economica/ La critica 29, no. 4 (November 20, 1931): 401-2, specifically p. 404. This essay has been translated into English as "The Worldly Pair of Sciences: Aesthetic and Economic，' and this is the relevant passage:

Now "sense" had two associated but distinct meanings, firstly, that which in knowledge is not logical and ratiocinative, but sensible and intuitive； and, secondly, that which in practical activity is not in itself moral and dutiful but pursued because liked and desired, useful and pleasurable. Consequently, the doctrine which rehabilitates sense developed on the one hand into a logic of the senses or poetic logic, science of pure intuitive knowledge or Aesthetic, and on the other hand into a logic of the pleasurable or useful, Economic in the widest sense, and all this was nothing more nor less than a theoretical "redemption of the flesh/7 as it is called, a redemption of life as life, of earthly love in all its aspects. (B. Croce, Philosophy, Poetry, History: An Anthology of Essays, trans. Cecil Sprigge [London: Oxford University Press, 1966], p. 753)

§43. Reformation and Renaissance
I. See Boris Souvarine, "Perspectives de travail/7 La critique sociale I, no. I (March 1931): 1-4. Boris Souvarine was the name used by Boris Lipschitz (also spelled Lifschitz and transcribed as Liefscitz by Gramsci), born in Kiev in 1893； who became a naturalized French citizen in 1906. Between 1921 and 1923, Souvarine was the French Communist Party representative on the executive committee of the Communist International in Moscow. He was expelled from the party in 1924. It is quite likely that Gramsci met and came to know Souvarine in Moscow； at the very least, he came to know enough about him to have learned his original name and remembered it (and which he uses here possibly as a precaution against a potentially inquisitive censor).

Apropos of La critique sociale, Gramsci wrote to Tatiana Schucht on July 27, 1931：

It怎 probably best if they don't send me any more new magazines, as they've done recently. I would like to continue reading only one of them: it is the bibliographic review of sociology published by Marcel Rivière and entitled La Critique Sociale, of which I have received the first issue dated March 19, 1931, and that comes out only six times a year. It isn't very well turned out, and indeed it is a sign of decadence that a justly accredited publishing house like Rivière^ should publish a medley that is so disorganized and without a serious scientific orientation； nevertheless, just so as to have a French bibliographic review and since it isn't very cumbersome and expensive, I want to get it. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:48.)

2. On Maurice Barrès, see Notebook 3, §2/ n. 6.

3. Gramsci is referring to Rosa Luxemburg's essay "Stillstand und Fortschritt im Marxismus,n (Stagnation and progress of Marxism), first published in Vorwärts, on March 14, 1903. See Notebook 3, §31, n. 7.

§44. Reformation and Renaissance
1. The November 1, 1930, issue of The Economist contained a "Russian Supplement" that was devoted to an analysis (by an unidentified author) of the first Soviet Five-Year Plan. This note must have been written after July 26, 1931, since Gramsci could not have known the identity of the author of the supplement before then.

On June 29, 1931, Gramsci wrote to Tatiana Schucht: "You may write Piero that I am making rapid progress in the reading of English； I find it much easier than German. I read fairly rapidly, even though my small dictionary is not quite adequate and lacks many technical terms and idioms currently in use. I read the extract from the Economist on the Five Year Plan in two or three days, and I don't think a single word escaped me,z (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:44； translation slightly modified).

Tatiana Schucht, as always, passed the information on to Piero Sra任a, who wrote back to her on July 11, 1931: 〃I am delighted that Nino has been mastering English, which will make it easier for him to keep abreast of things. As for the dictionary ... Fll have the Concise Oxford Dictionary sent to him. . . . The author of the extract from the Economist that Nino read is Michael Farbman, former correspondent of the Observer, who now lives in London and concerns himself with the League of Nations. Published anonymously, it was much more authoritative than it would have been if the readers of the Economist knew that it was written by a journalist. A French translation of it has just been published” (Piero Sraffa, Lettere a Tania per Gramsci, ed. Valentino Gerratana [Rome: Riuniti, 1991], p. 14).

Tatiana Schucht, in turn, passed this information on to Gramsci (transcribing it verbatim) in a letter dated July 26/ 1931. (See A. Gramsci and T. Schucht, Lettere: 1926-1935, ed. A. Natoli and C. Daniele [Turin: Einaudi, 1997], P. 74。).

Michael S. Farbman (1880-1933) was the Moscow correspondent of the Manchester Guardian and the Observer in the years immediately following the revolution. In 1917 he published a booklet entitled The Russian Revolution and the War. His other books include Russia and the Struggle for Peace (1918), Bolshevism in Retreat (1923), and After Lenin (1924). He conducted an interview of Lenin that was published in the Manchester Guardian on November 22, 1922 (reprinted in V.I. Lenin, Collected Works, vol. 33, August 1921-March 1923 [London: Lawrence and Wishart/ 1966], pp. 383-89). His book Piatiletka: Russia's $-yeai Plan (New York: New Republic, 1931) was also published in French, German, and Yiddish. He is not to be confused (as he has been in some editions of Gramsci怎 writings) with R.B. Farbman (b. 1893), also known by his pseudonym R.B. Rafail, who was Communist Party secretary in the Ukraine, belonged to the "democratic centralism" faction in the beginning of the 1920s, and was finally expelled from the party in 1933.

2. That is, the USSR.

3. Gramsci is referring to Thomas G. Masaryk's Russland und Europa: Studien über die geistegen Strömungen in Russland, Erste Folge. Zur russischen Geschichts- und Religionsphilosophie. Soziologische Skizzen, 2 vols. (Jena: Diederichs, 1913).

Leon Trotsky published an article on Masaryk's book, z/Professor Masaryk über Russland/7 in the Viennese social-democratic monthly Der Kampf, nos. 11-12 (December 1914): 519-27. Gramsci had Trotsky's article translated into Italian and brought it out under the title "La Russia pre-revoluzionaria/, (Prerevolutionary Russia) in the last issue of II grido del popolo 23, no. 743 (dated erroneously October 19, 191& and actually October 26, 1918)； he then published it again under the title "Lo spirito della civiltà russa” (The spirit of Russian civilization) in Uordine nuovo 2/ no. 6 (June 19/ 1920): 43-45.

Masaryk's work was translated into English as The Spirit of Russia: Studies in History, Literature, and Philosophy, trans. Eden Paul and Cedar Paul, 2 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1919), and later into Italian as La Russia e FEuropa: Studi sulle correnti spirituali in Russia, trans. Ettore Lo Gatto, 2 vols. (Naples: Ricciardi, 1922； Rome: Istituto Romane Editoriale, 1925). Gramsci calls it "Masaryks book on Dostoyevsky" because, in Masaryk's own words, /zthe entire study is devoted to Dostoyevsky, but I lacked the literary skill requisite for the interweaving of all I wanted to say into an account of that author" [The Spirit of Russia, p. vii).

On Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, see Notebook 3/ §40, n. 4.

4. Gramsci derived the bibliographical data on the French edition of Thomas G. Masaryk's book of memoirs, La résmrection d'un état: Souvenirs et reflexions, 1914-1918 (Paris: Pion, 1930), and all the information about its contents from a review of it, signed F.R., in La critique sociale 1, no. I (March 1931): 22.

§46. On the Popular Manual. Teleology

1. Gramsci is alluding to the Marxist concept of the "historical task" or "historical mission" of the proletariat.

2. See Notebook 4, §i6z and n. 1 there, and §27.

§47. On the Popular Manual

1. N.I. Bukharin, "Theory and Practice from the Standpoint of Dialectical Materialism,/z in Science at the Cross Roads: Papers Presented at the International Congress of the History of Science and Technology Held in London from June 29th to July 3rd, 1931 by the Delegates of the U.S.S.R. (London: Kniga, 1931), pp. 9-33. Gramsci received a copy of this volume on August 31, 1931, as he informed Tatiana Schucht in a letter on the same day.

2. Bukharin wrote:

Nearly all the schools of philosophy, from theologising metaphysics

to the Avenarian-Machist philosophy of the "pure description" and renovated "pragmatism," with the exception of dialectical materialism (Marxism), start from the thesis, considered irrefutable, that "I" have been "given" only "my〃 own sensations.

This statement, the most brilliant exponent of which was Bishop Berkeley, is quite unnecessarily exalted into a new gospel of epistemology. ...Nevertheless, it is not only vulnerable, but will not stand the test of serious criticism....

In point of fact, it is only in the case of the first-created Adam, just manufactured out of clay and for the first time seeing, again with eyes opened for the first time, the landscape of paradise with all its attributes, that such a statement could be made. ("Theory and Practice from the Standpoint of Dialectical Materialism," pp. 11-12)

On Filippo Crispolti, see Notebook 3, §37, n. 5.

4. Ibid., p. 141. The emphases are Gramsci's.

5. The source of this epigram is most probably the following passage in chapter 5 of Octave Mirbeau怎 novel Le iournal dfune femme de chambre (1900):

M. Paul Bourget was the intimate friend and spiritual guide of the Countess Fardin, in whose house I served last year as a chambermaid. I had always heard it said that he alone knew, even to its subsoil, the complex soul of woman,...

One day my mistress sent me to carry an "urgent letter" to the illustrious master. He handed me the reply himself. Then I made bold to put to him the question that tormented me. . . . M. Paul Bourget asked:

"What is your friend? A woman of the people? A poor woman undoubtedly ?,z

“A chambermaid like myself, illustrious master.

A superior grimace, a look of disdain, appeared on M. Bourget's face....

“I do not occupy myself with these souls/7 said he. "These are too little souls. They are not even souls. They are outside the province of my psychology.

I understood that, in this province, one begins to have a soul only with an income of a hundred thousand francs. (O. Mirbeau, Celestine, Being the Diary of a Chambermaid, trans. Alan Durst [New York: W. Faro, 1930]/ pp. 76-77)

The information on this source was kindly provided to me by Derek Boothman.

On Paul Bourget, see Notebook 3/ §37/ n. 4.

6. Crispolti writes: /z[Manzoni] therefore enthusiastically endorsed the theory on which Augustin Thierry was basing his historical researches, namely, the separation in the Middle Ages between the conquering and the conquered races, and he did so because this enabled the oppressed, the forgotten, and the humble to become once again the object o£ history77 (“Nuove indagini sul Manzoni/〃 p. 139).

Augustin Thierry (1795-1856), a great admirer of Saint-Simon, is often regarded as an exemplar of romantic historiography. His reading of history in racial or national terms is exemplified by one of his best-known works, Lhistoire de la conquéte de PAngleterre par les Normands (1825； published in English translation that same year as History of the Conquest of England by the Normans}, and his progressive views are very much in evidence in the booklet he coauthored with Henri Saint-Simon, De la ré-organisation de la société européenne (1814) and in his Essai sur Phistoire de la formation et des progrès du Tiers Etat (1850).

At this point in the manuscript, there is a sentence, enclosed in parentheses, that Gramsci crossed out； however, it remains legible: "In this regard, Croce's assertion in Storia della storiografia in Italia nel secolo XIX is particularly strange: he states that only in Italy—and not in France一has there been research on racial conflict in the Middle Ages as the origin of the division of society into the privileged orders and the third estate―in fact, the opposite is true, etc.〃

Gramsci probably canceled this sentence because he realized that it does not accurately represent Croce's view. The pertinent text is Benedetto Croce, Storia della storiografìa italiana nel secolo decimonono, 2 vols. (Bari: Laterza, 1921)—specifically, vcl. i, p.      一in which Croce

compares Manzoni's Discorso sopra alcuni punti della storia longobardica (Discourse on some aspects of Longobard history) with the theories of Augustin Thierry and Francois Guizot. Manzoni's Discorso is the product of the historical research he had conducted in the course of writing his play Adelchi, which deals with Longobard rule over the Romans in the eighth century； it is perhaps in this play that Thierry's influence on Manzoni stands out most clearly. Gramsci touches on the Manzoni-Thierry connection again in Notebook 14, §39.

On Ugo Mion] see Notebook 3/ §63, n. 17, and §100； and Notebook 4, §90.

§53. Past and present. Germany's debts and payments to America
i. This note may have been prompted by Mariano D'Amelio's article 〃I1 piano Hoover” (The Hoover plan), in Gerarchia nz no. 8 (August 1931): 550-58, in which D'Amelio makes reference to two earlier articles of his that Gramsci might also have read: "Dal piano Dawes al piano Young” (From the Dawes plan to the Young plan), Gerarchia 9, no. 6 (June 1929): 423-3S; and 〃I1 piano Young approvato” (Youngs怎 plan approved), Gerarchia 9Z no. 9 (September 1929): 688-95.

The Balfour note was a proposal put forward in 1922 by the then acting foreign secretary of Great Britain practically to cancel the debts incurred by the World War European Allies among themselves and have Britain recover just enough of what it was owed to make its own debt payments to the United States； this was seen as an incentive for the Allies, and especially France, to agree to alleviating the burden of reparations imposed on Germany. The United States objected to the linking of the war debt issue with the question of reparations. At the first London Conference, in August 1922, France refused to endorse a moratorium on reparations payments. The second London conference, held in December of the same year, again failed to generate consensus on the debt and reparations issues. Two years later, a joint U.S.-British commission chaired by Charles Dawes, an American, produced a plan to provide Germany with some financial relief and restructure its reparations payments； the plan was approved by the Allies and by Germany in August 1924. In 1929 another committee, also chaired by an American, Owen Young, proposed yet another restructuring of reparations obligations and payments that was, once again, favorable to Germany. The plan was adopted the following year. Before long, however, the further deterioration of the German economy along with the world economic crisis altered the situation drastically. In June 1931, the U.S. president Herbert Hoover proposed a one-year moratorium on all reparation and debt payments, Although Hoover's plan was approved, albeit very reluctantly, by Congress and the other leading nations, it had no effect on the economic crisis. In his articles, Mariano D'Amelio maintained that the Italian delegation at the London Conference had come up with the idea of resolving the debt and reparations issues in tandem even before the Balfour note.

§54. Past and present. The land problem
i. This note was probably prompted by Silvio Longhi's article "Il bene di famiglia,/ (Family property), in Gerarchia 11, no. 8 (August 1931): 651-54.

§55. Past and present
i. The first issue of the monthly Gerarchia, founded by Benito Mussolini, was published in January 1922. Although the masthead listed Mussolini as the editor-in-chief, he entrusted its direction to his mistress and confidante, Margherita Sarfatti.

In this article, the quadrumvir Bianchi asserts that on the night of October 27, 1928, he could not get in touch with the other quadrumvir, De Vecchi, who was in Rome, and that he sent him a letter—reproduced in the article一urging him to do "'everything possible to be in Perugia" the following day.

i. All the information up to this point is derived from an article by Carlo Foà, 〃La battaglia della soja〃 (The soybean battle), Gerarchia 9, no. 2 (February 1929): 157-61. Foà's article summarized the contents of a book by V. Ducceschi on soybeans and nutrition in Italy, La soja e Pulimentazione nazionale (Milan: Vallardi, 1928). The observations that follow are Gramsci's.

3. Diego Martelli (1838-1896), an art critic, was a promoter and patron of the Tuscan school of painters known as the Macchinoli, many of whom spent time on the property he owned in Castiglioncello, where they produced some of their best-known work. The innovative treatment of light and color that typifi.es the Macchiaioli school has been described by some art historians as protoimpressionist. A frequenter of the legendary Caffè Michelangelo in Florence, Martelli was also a republican and an Italian nationalist and moved in politically progressive circles. His memoirs, Ricordi della mia prima età, mentioned in Bacci's article, exist only in manuscript, though they have been extensively quoted by critics and historians. Martelli^ collection of Macchiaioli paintings is now housed in the Gallery of Modern Art at the Pitti Palace in Florence.

4. Atto Vannucci (1810-83), a teacher of Latin in Florence and a nationalist who played an active role in the political rebellions of 1848, wrote a four-volume historical work. Storia d'Italia dall'origine di Roma all,invasione dei Lombardi (i86i)z intended to show the roots of Italian national identity in classical antiquity. A friend and political ally of Giuseppe Mazzoni, he was also affiliated with the journal Ualba.

Giuseppe Arcangeli (1807-55), a fellow student of Vannucci's at the seminary in Prato, became a teacher of classical literature at the Collegio Cicognini and published translations of and commentaries on Cicero, Virgil, Callimachus, and Lucretius that went through many editions.

Vincenzo Manteri, one of the leading chemical engineers of the time, was brought from Livorno to Tuscany by the grand duke Leopold to help with a mining project meant to provide for the development of steel production in Tuscany.

Pietro Thouar (1809-61) worked for Gian PietroVieusseux^ publishing enterprise for a while and then went on to become a major figure in the field of education, publishing a number of popular journals, including innovative newspapers for children, such as II giornale per i fanciulli.

Antonio Mordini (1819-1902), a lawyer and statesman, played a leading role in the drafting of a liberal constitution in the short-lived effort to liberalize the government of Florence, and he was appointed minister of foreign affairs by the 1849 revolutionary triumvirate government.

Giuseppe Mazzoni (1808-80), Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi (180473), and Giuseppe Montanelli (1813-62) constituted the triumvirate that governed Tuscany for a few months following the flight of the grand duke Leopold in February 1849. On Guerrazzi, see also Notebook iz §44, n. 37.

Vincenzo Salvagnoli (1808-6 i)z a lawyer and liberal closely watched and harried by the police, was a member of Vieusseux's intellectual circle； he was also a member of the Tuscan parliament before 1848. Salvagnoli had a keen interest in literature and authored a posthumously published booklet on Stendhal, with whom he corresponded.

2. Piero Vettori (1499-1585), a philologist and humanist considered the leading classical scholar in Florence of his time, produced translations and commentaries on a wide range of Greek and Latin texts. He also wrote poetry, orations, and other works in Latin, as well as a treatise in the vernacular on the cultivation of olives, Trattato delle lodi e della coltivazione degli ulivi (1569).

3. Vitelli, "Ricordi di un vecchio normalista,p. 282.

4. Robert Estienne (1503-59), whose father had established a print shop-publishing company in Paris； moved to Geneva to embark on a similar enterprise there. One of the most important pioneers of French lexicography, he gained renown with his Thesaurus linguae latinae (1531). His son, Henri Estienne (1531-98), a classical philologist, ran into trouble with the Geneva authorities for publishing a French commentary on Herodotus that was deemed offensive for its implied criticism of sixteenth-century beliefs and mores. Besides many editions of Greek and Latin texts, Estienne also produced a monumental lexicographical work, the five-volume Thesaurus graecae linguae (1572). He is also remembered for his defense and promotion of the French language.

Gramsci's comment that the Estiennes were Huguenots is probably based on his reading of Gustave Lanson, Histoire de la littérature fran-Qaise, 19th ed. (Paris: Hachette, n.dj； see pp. 300-301. Lanson's literary history is not among Gramsci's books that have been preserved, but there is no doubt that he had direct access to it since he quotes from it verbatim in Notebook 8, §109.

John Addington Symonds (1840-93) was the author of, among many other things, the exhaustive seven-volume study Renaissance in Italyf first published in London between 1875 and 1886.

Richard C. Jebb (1841-1905) was best known for his scholarly writings and commentaries on as well as his translations and editions of classical Greek writers, especially Sophocles.

§69. Catholic Action
i. A good part of Pius Xi's encyclical Quadragesimo anno (issued on May i5z 1931) is devoted to the question of whether some forms of socialism (as opposed to communism, which is dismissed out of hand) could be considered compatible with Catholicism. While acknowledging some benign aspects of socialism, the pope nonetheless declared it irreconcilable with Catholicism:

One might say that. . . Socialism inclines toward and in certain measure approaches the truth which Christian tradition has always held sacred； for it cannot be denied that its demands at times come very near those that Christian reformers of society justly insist upon.

... We make this pronouncement: Whether considered as a doctrine, or an historical fact, or a movement, Socialism, if it remains truly Socialism, even after it has yielded to truth and justice on the points we have mentioned, cannot be reconciled with the teachings of the Catholic Church because its concept of society itself is utterly foreign to Christian truth....

If Socialism, like all errors, contains some truth (which, moreover, Supreme Pontiffs have never denied), it is based nevertheless on a theory of human society peculiar to itself and irreconcilable with true Christianity. Religious socialism, Christian socialism, are contradictory terms； no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist. [The Papal Encyclicals, ed. C. Carlen [Wilmington, N.C.: McGrath, 1981], pp. 433—34)

On Leo XIII and his encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), see Notebook I, §77/ n. 2.

Gramsci obtained his information about the speech by Cardinal Francis Bourne, the archbishop of Westminster, from two items that appeared in the June 19, 1931, issue of the Manchester Guardian Weekly (24, no. 25), which he received more or less regularly at Turi.

One item, entitled "Catholics and Politics: Cardinal Bourne's Ruling,f, appears in the "News of the Week" section. It consists of a brief report on the main points made by Cardinal Bourne in a speech he delivered on June 17, 1931, including the following:

Cardinal Bourne, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, made particular reference to the recent Papal Encyclical in an address on "The Church and Socialism" in Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on Wednesday evening.

The Catholic Church, he said, as such has nothing whatever to do with any political party. She had never enunciated a scheme of politics. There was nothing in the Gospel that told them to which political party they ought to belong. ... If the political party was definitely based on non-Christian principles, no Catholic would be justified in belonging to that party.

"Happily we may safely say/7 proceeded the Cardinal, zzthat there is no political party at the present time in England which definitely takes its stand on non-Christian principles. . .

The Cardinal's general conclusions were, first, that in this country a man or woman is free to join the political party which makes the greatest appeal to his sympathy and understanding； secondly, that having done so, he or she must be on guard against erroneous principles which on account of the a任iliations which affect these parties are to some extent at work within them； and thirdly, he may never deliver himself or his conscience wholly into the keeping of any political party.

The other item is the brief note /zCatholics and Socialism" placed in the section Z/The Week〃：

Cardinal Bourne in a speech delivered in Edinburgh on Wednesday gave a reassuring interpretation of the Pope's recent encyclical. In his view there is nothing in it to prevent a Catholic from joining any English political party. The Labour party in Cardinal Bourne怎 view, apparently, is not a Socialist party or, at any rate, its socialism is not of the pernicious type that falls under the Pope's condemnation. This is a little confusing, because the summaries of the encyclical published in this country seemed to make it clear beyond a doubt that even the mildest brand of Socialism was incompatible with the faith of a true Catholic. The apparent inconsistency is perhaps explained by a distinction between the theory and practice of the Labour party. There is certainly no sign of a desire to turn the world upside down in the record of the Government, and what Cardinal Bourne probably intended to convey was that a Catholic by walking warily might generally support Labour without being stung by Socialism which undoubtedly coils itself around the roots of the Labour movement.

§70. History of the subaltern classes. Italian intellectuals
i. Alfredo Fanzini, "Biancofiore/ Corriere della sera, December 2, 1931.

On Alfredo Fanzini, see Notebook 1, §13, n. 1.

Severino Ferrari (1856-1905), a litterateur and author of three books of poetry, was a follower of Giosuè Carducci, with whom he coauthored a commentary on Petrarch's Canzoniere. He wrote his satiric poem 〃I1 mago〃 (The wizard) in 1884. Ferrari was drawn to the political circle of Andrea Costa； who came to socialism by way of anarchism, hence Fanzini zs allusion to the influence of Bakunin.

§75. Popular literature
i. All the information in this note is culled from a newspaper article by Antonio Baldini, ^Tutta-di-tutti,tf in the Corriere della sera, December 6, 1931.

Paolina Leopardi (1800-69) was the sister of the poet Giacomo Leopardi； Monaldo Leopardi (1776-1847) was their father. //Tutta-di-tutti,/ was Mansaldo's nickname for his daughter, Paolina. An inveterate reactionary and absolute monarchist, Monaldo Leopardi published the periodical Voce della ragione (Voice of reason) with the help of his daughter between 1832 and 1835, when it was suppressed. Prospero Viani (1812-92) corresponded with Paolina Leopardi, eager to learn every detail of the great poet's life. Viani published the earliest major editions of Giacomo Leopardi's letters. Camillo Antona Traversi (1857-1934), a playwright, essayist, and literary biographer, wrote extensively on Leopardi. On Giacomo Leopardi, see Notebook 5, §101, n. 3.

§84. Encyclopedic notions. Mysticism
1. The School of Fascist Mysticism, founded in Milan in April 1930, was the brainchild of Niccolò Giani. Most of its members, who professed absolute faith in Mussolini and dedicated themselves completely to Fascism (which they equated with patriotism), came from the ranks of Fascist University Groups (GFU). Giani, who directed the school, also edited the Varese daily Cronaca prealpina)he died in combat in 1941. The Duce's brother, Arnaldo Mussolini, editor-in-chief of the Popolo dfItalia, was a patron and promoter of the school.

2. Arnaldo Mussolini, "Coscienza e dovere” (Conscience and duty). Gente nostra 3, no. 50 (December 13/ 1931). An illustrated weekly. Gente nostra was probably made available to the inmates of the Turi prison.

3. The last sentence was probably added some time after the rest of the note had been written. It alludes to a book by Benedetto Croce, Storia d'Europa del secolo decimonono, id ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1932), that Gramsci had not yet received when he finished writing this notebook.

In the first chapter of his Storia d'Europa, Croce writes:

Now he who . . . considers all these characteristics of the liberal ideal does not hesitate to call it what it was: a "religion. 〃 He calls it so, of course, because he looks for what is essential and intrinsic in every religion, which always lies in the concept of reality and an ethics that conforms to this concept. It excludes the mythological element which constitutes only a secondary differentiation between religion and philosophy. The concept of reality and the conforming ethics were generated ...by modern thought, dialectical and historical. Nothing more was needed to give them a religious character. . . . The religion of liberalism showed itself to be essentially religious in its forms and institutions and, since it was born not made, was no cold and deliberate device. Therefore at first its leaders even expected to be able to live in harmony with the old religions. ... As a matter of fact it set itself against them, but at the same time summed them up in itself and went further. Beside philosophical motives it set the religious motives of the near and remote past. Next to and above Socrates it set the human and divine Redeemer Jesus. And it felt it had undergone all the experiences of paganism and Christianity, of Catholicism, Augustinianism, Calvinism and all the rest. It felt that it represented the highest demands, that it was the purifying, deepening, and power-giving agent of the religious life of mankind. (B. Croce, History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century, trans. H. Furst [New York: Harcourt Brace, 1933, pp. 18-19)

§85. Encyclopedic notions. Doctiinairism and doctrinaire
I. Francois Guizot (1787-1874) and Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard (17631845) were doctrinaires, the early-nineteenth-century group of moderate conservatives who stood for constitutional monarchy, and thus were at odds with absolute monarchists and the sovereigns who attempted to bypass parliament and exercise autocratic power.

The quoted passage is on pp. 240-41, and the emphases are Gramsci's. Though the articles in La civiltà cattolica were unsigned, the major contributors were known, and Mario Barbera, S.J., did in fact write on issues related to education in the Jesuit periodical. Mario Barbera, S.J., was also the author of Libertà ^insegnamento: Piincipii e proposte (Rome: Civilità Cattolica, 1919) and II buono e il cattivo della riforma Gentile (Rome: F.I.U.C., 1925).

§91. Past and present. Postwar tendencies in the external organization of human productive factors
1. This is a reference to the Jesuit-organized settlements of indigenous groups in Paraguay. Known as reducciones (i.e., concentrations), the settlements were started in the early seventeenth century and lasted until the suppression of the Society of Jesus in the 1760s.

2. In Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica, 4th ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1921), of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi, Benedetto Croce wrote: "The Jesuits taught the savages how to cultivate their fields； their supposed C ampan ell a- type communism was ultimately a clever form of capitalistic exploitation and a great source of income for the religious order” (p. 211). This observation occurs in the chapter "Sulla storiografìa socialistica: Il comuniSmo di Tommaso Campanella” (On socialist historiography: The communism of Tommaso Campanella), which is not included in the English translation of Croce's book, Historical Materialism and the Economics of Karl Marx (London: Allen and Unwin, 1914).

§93. Political terminology. Privileges and prerogatives
i. The Fascist Grand Council was created in December 1922, shortly after Mussolini's advent to power； it was conceived as an organ of the Fascist Party with a consultative function but no legal power. Six years later, however, an act of parliament transformed it into an extremely powerful body with the role of coordinating and integrating the activities of the Fascist regime. Presided over by Mussolini, its members included the qua-drumvirs of the March on Rome (see Notebook 6, §150, n. i), the most important cabinet ministers, the presidents of the senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the president of the Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State, the commander of the militia, the presidents of the national confederations of workers and employees, and some other very high-ranking or prominent figures.

§94. The English Labour movement. The Archbishop of Canterbury
i. The quotation is taken from a brief note that appeared under the title Primate and Labour Party" in the Manchester Guardian Weekly 25, no. 18 (October 30, 1931). The archbishop of Canterbury at the time was Cardinal Francis Bourne.

4. Antonio Capece Minutolo, prince of Canosa (1768-1838), monarchist and intransigent antiliberal, followed the Bourbon King Ferdinand to Sicily when the French invaded Naples in 1806. In 1816, one year after the restoration of Bourbon rule, and again in 1821, the prince of Canosa was appointed chief of police； on both occasions, his inflexibility and absolutist views quickly led to his replacement. After his second abbreviated stint as police chief, he left the Kingdom of Naples, moved to Modena, and became active in reactionary circles, making common cause with such figures as Cesare Taparelli D'Azeglio, Monaldo Leopardi, and the monsignor Giuseppe Baraldi, founder of the periodical Memorie di religione, di morale, e di letteratura. Baraldi's periodical and the prince of Canosa's affiliations with militant Catholic conservatives are mentioned in 〃La fortuna del Lamennais e le prime manifestazioni d'Azione Cattolica in Italia,n one of the two articles Gramsci cites in the opening sentence of this note.

§103. Encyclopedic notions. Public opinion
i. The phrase "confederation of the three oppressed'7 echoes Bukharin's derisive characterization of the kind of social (dis)order that would ensue if the anarchists were to prevail. The relevant passage occurs in Bukharin's booklet Programma kommunistov (bolshevikov), first published in Moscow in 1918 (an English translation of Bukharin's pamphlet appeared the same year it was first published in Moscow； see N. Bukharin, Program of the Communists [Bolshevists] [New York: Communist Labor Party, 1918].) Gramsci published substantial segments of it in Italian translation in several issues of L'ordine nuovo, under the general heading "Il programma del Partito comunista” (Program of the Communist Party). The following excerpt is from the segment subtitled "Società anarchica o comunista?” (Anarchist or communist society?):

The anarchists believe that people would be better off if all production were divided among small confederations of workers (communities). In other words, several small associations would be formed by spontaneous agreement, and they would start working at their risk and peril. These small confederations would then start entering into negotiations with one another and would gradually reach agreements and finalize nonco-ercive contracts. . . . Now, it is obvious that anarchist theory does not lead to an orderly organization of society but rather to division, because of the simple fact that small anarchic communities are certainly not large workers7 bodies comprising many people but small groupings that sometimes may consist of two single individuals. There was one such group in Petrograd: "The group of the five oppressed," but according to anarchist theory one could even have a "league of the two oppressed." One can only imagine what would happen if every group of five or of two persons were to start requisitioning, confiscating, and working on its own. [Uordine nuovo 1, no. 30 [December 20, 1919]: 239)

On the other segments of Bukharin's Program of the Communists (Bolsheviks} that Gramsci published in Uordine nuovo and on the edition of the same work by the Avanti! publishing house, see Notebook 6, §167/ n. 1.

§105. Father Bresciani's progeny. Ardengo Soffici
i. Lemmonio Boreo, a novel by Ardengo Soffici (see Notebook 1, §8/ n. I； and Notebook i, §9), was first published in Florence in 1911 by the publishing house of La voce, the literary-cultural periodical with which he was closely associated at the time. A new version of the novel, twice as long as the original, was published by Vallecchi of Florence in 1921. Jean-Christophe, by Romain Rolland (1866-1944), is a roman-fleuve that was initially published serially in the Cahiers de la quinzaine between 1904 and 1912. The connection between the two novels and the gist of Soffici's Lemmonio Boreo is succinctly described by David Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith:

According to Prezzolini [see Notebook 1, §8, n. 1], Rolland's novel made a great impression on the group of La Voce, which included Soffici. Lemmonio Boreo (1911) is the first volume of an unfinished novel in which the eponymous hero returns to Tuscany after ten years abroad, absorbs himself in books and newspapers which give him the measure of the intellectual and moral degeneracy of the country and embarks on a campaign of correction, attempting with the aid of a proletarian zzstrong man" and a petty-bourgeois intellectual to restore justice to the people. In one of the central episodes the trio joins with a group of anarchists and they violently disrupt a socialist rally. (The passage is translated in Adrian Lyttleton (ed.); Italian Fascisms, London [Jonathan Cape] 1973.) Piero Gobetti wrote in 1922 that Lemmonio Boreo had become the11 Iliad of fascism" and Malaparte in 1923 called Soffici one of the "ptophets of fascism.” (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from Cultural Writings, ed. D. Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith； trans. W. Boelhower [London: Lawrence and Wishart, 198$^ p. 33211)

Comparisons, both favorable and unfavorable, between Lemmonio Boreo and fean-Christophe were made by some of the first critics to write on Soffici's novel. See, for example, the negative assessment in Giovanni Boine's "Don Chisciotte in Toscana” (Don Quixote in Tuscany) accompanied by Giovanni Papini's rebuttal in La voce 4, no. 8 (April 18/ 1912).

Gramsci expressed his interest in and admiration for Romain Rolland (from whom he adopted the motto "pessimism of the intelligence, optimism of the will〃)in his preprison writings. In one of his editorials on the front page of Uordine nuovo (1, no. 16 [August 30, 1919]: m), Gramsci described Rolland as 〃the Maxim Gorki of Latin Europe.n Elsewhere, he described fean-Christophe as the symbol of the anxious search for meaning and for a sense of a shared humanity across cultures and nationalities during a period of spiritual crisis and general divisiveness (in the obituary of Ernst Haeckel, in the Piedmont edition of Avanti! 23/ no. 221 [August 12, 1919]).

DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT

A ruled school notebook (14.7 x 19.8 cm) with hard black covers and a black spine. A label on the front cover carries the imprint of the stationer: "Gius. Laterza e figli, Bari." Inside the blank space of the label, Gramsci's prison number (7047) is written in black pencil； next to it, in ink and apparently in Gramsci's hand, is the number "I." After Gramsci's death, Tatiana Schucht glued another label on the upper right-hand corner of the front cover； on it, she wrote: ^Completo da pg. I a 160. XXVIII” (Complete from p. 1 to 160. XXVIII). The Roman numerals indicate the number Tatiana Schucht assigned the notebook according to a cataloging system she had devised when organizing Gramsci's papers soon after his death. This notebook has the same physical characteristics as Notebooks 3, 5, 6, and 7.

The notebook consists of seventy-nine leaves with twenty-one lines on each side and unlined endpapers in front and back. The recto side of the front endpaper is stamped with the prison seal and with the seal of the prison warden. A signature underneath the latter is undecipherable； it is identical to the signature on the front endpapers of Notebook 5 and Notebook 6. The recto side of each leaf is numbered (1-79) in black ink and stamped with the prison seal: "Casa penale speciale di Turi” (Special Prison of Turi). The verso side of the last lined leaf is also numbered (80) in the same black ink and in the same hand, but it is not stamped with the prison seal. The recto side of the unlined endpaper at the back (which is neither numbered nor stamped with the prison seal)

contains一in addition to a short list of books (see below)—five short notes that are not preceded by the sign (§) with which Gramsci usually marks the beginning of each note. All five notes were subsequently crossed out by Gramsci when he integrated them in other notebooks. These five notes appear as <§24。to <§245〉in this edition. These are in turn followed by what appears to be the beginning of another note, which is canceled by a wavering line that renders it somewhat difficult to decipher. The following is a tentative rendition: "5. The question of the language. Whether an Italian theater exists. Why Italian literature is not popular/7

All the pages of the notebook are fully used, except for the following: p. iv (entirely blank except for the first line), p. 2r (bottom ten lines blank), p. 2v (entirely blank), and p. 50V (bottom eight lines blank).

In addition to a general note on the opening page, a one-line entry (on p. iv), and a list of topics (on p. ir), this notebook contains 245 notes or sections. Of these, 98 are entirely crossed out but remain clearly legible, and all but one were later incorporated by Gramsci in other notebooks； following Valentino Gerratana's denomination, these are called A texts. The sole exception is a short note on p. 5 iv in the manuscript (§168 in this edition), which was never integrated into any other notebook. Another 146 notes are B texts: they were neither crossed out nor used again in other notebooks. Further, there is one somewhat anomalous note (§214 in this edition): its first part is an A text, while the rest of it is a B text.

The manuscript of the notebook also contains some bibliographical notations. On p. 7yr, Gramsci listed thirteen titles under the heading "Bibliography”:

Vincenzo Gioberti一Pagine scelte edite ed inedite一edited P. A. Menzio

(Paravia), 20 lire

At the top of the recto side of the endpaper at the back of the notebook, the following short list appears under the heading "Ediz. Utet—Torino”:

Cesare Balbo一Le Speranze d'Italia一edited by A. Corbelli一L. 8

The materials in this notebook are divided into two blocks, with a small break between the two (the blank lines at the bottom of p. 50V). The 165 notes that fill p. 3r to p. 50V are mostly B texts on miscellaneous topics, whereas the 80 notes from p. 5 ir to the end constitute the third (and final) series of "Notes on Philosophy. Materialism and Idealism" that Gramsci started in Notebook 4 (§1-§48) and continued in Notebook 7 (§1-§48).

Though it is not easy to determine with precision when Gramsci made the first entries in this notebook, there can be no doubt that the general observations and notations on the first page of the manuscript were written before (probably well before) the two large blocks of notes that start on p. 3r and p. sir. The /zGroupings of Subjects" on p. 2r, on the other hand, may have been among the last entries in this notebook. All indications are that the third series of "Notes on Philosophy" was started sometime during the last month or two of 1931. In §172 (p. 53V in the manuscript), Gramsci refers in passing to the death of Alessandro Chiappelli "this November 1931.〃 The sequence of miscellaneous notes that starts on p. 3r of the manuscript could not have been started before midJanuary 1932: §1 contains a reference to the Corriere della sera of January 9, 1932. It is also obvious that for a while the composition of the two segments of the notebook overlapped. In §222 (p. 73V in the manuscript), Gramsci explicitly refers to a note on economics (§128) on p. 40 of the manuscript. The datable sources used in the block of miscellaneous notes stretch from January 1932 (see §1 and §18) to the end of April of the same year (see §162, where Gramsci alludes to a remark by Piero Sraffa that Tatiana Schucht had passed on to him in a letter dated April 27/ 1932). As for the "Notes on Phi-losophy〃： they appear to have been completed sometime in middle or late May 1932. In §237 (p. 78V in the manuscript), Gramsci mentions Luigi Russo's edition of Machavellizs Princef which was one of the books that he received in prison in early May 1932.

In Uofficina gramsciana: Ipotesi sulla struttura dei nQuaderni del carcere^ (pp. 142-43), Gianni Francioni offers the following chronology of the composition of Notebook 8:

NOTES TO THE TEXT

Loose notes and jottings for a history of Italian intellectuals
I. These remarks on the provisional character of the notebooks echo the parenthetical caveat at the end of §16 in Notebook 4 and the prefatory statement on the first page of Notebook 11.

As the heading of this first entry indicates, Gramsci originally intended to use this notebook for his notes on intellectuals. As is obvious, he used it differently； later, however, he did devote a separate notebook (i.e., Notebook 12) to the topic of intellectuals.

2. On Gramscfs reformulation of his plans’ see the introduction to volume I, especially pp. 35ft

/zGroupings of subjects" is on p. ir of the manuscript but was written about fifteen months after "Principal essays/〃 which occupies p. ir of the manuscript； see the Description of the Manuscript.

On Ugo Foscolo and Dei Sepolcri, see Notebook 5, §32』n. 1. There is no specific work by Ugo Foscolo entitled Discorsi civili (Civil discourses)； Gramsci is referring generically to Foscolo's miscellaneous writings on his-toryz politics, and literature that have been collected and anthologized in many different editions. See, inter alia, Discorsi storici e letterarii di Ugo Foscolo (Milan: G. Resnatiz 1843)； Discorsi sulla lingua italiana (Milan: Istituto Editoriale Italiano, 1918)； Il pensiero civile e politico di Ugo Foscolo, ed. F. Guardione (Milan: Alpes, 1928)； and the national edition of Foscolo's complete works, especially volume 8, Prose politiche e letterarie dal 1811 al 1816, ed. Luigi Fassò (Florence: Le Monnier, 1933).

4. Manzoni and the French philologist Claude Fauriel (1772-1844) became friends during the Italian writer's stay in Paris in 1808. Fauriel would later translate Manzoni's tragedies into French.

Franelli's quotation from Manzoni's letter (which Gramsci transcribes) is on p. 478. As David Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith point out, however, "This letter—of 2 June 1832—is in fact to Marco Coen, not Claude Fauriel” (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from Cultural Writings, ed. D. Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans. W. Boelhower [London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1985], p. 25011).

Filippo Scolari (1369-1426), also known as Pippo Spano, moved to Hungary at the age of thirteen and fought in numerous campaigns for Sigismund of Luxemburg (king of Hungary from 1387 to 1437). Although he is best remembered for his many successful battles against the Turks, he also led a major military campaign against the Republic of Venice.

§5. Risorgimento. The Action Party
1. See "Una lettera politica inedita di Francesco De Sanctis” (A previously unpublished political letter by Francesco De Sanctis), in the ^Marginalia^ section of II marzocco 36, no. 40 (October 4, 1931).

On Francesco De Sanctis, see Notebook 1, §96, n. 3.

Giuseppe Civinini (1835-71) joined Garibaldi during the southern campaign and was with him in Aspromonte in August 1862 when Italian troops fought Garibaldi and defeated him, aborting his march on Rome. Civinini was arrested and imprisoned with Garibaldi on that occasion. He was elected to parliament in 1865 as a member of the Left (La Sinistra)； two years later, however, he successfully ran for reelection as a supporter of the Right and backed Prime Minister Bettino Ricasoli's failed attempt to negotiate a reconciliation of church and state. Civinini was also editorin-chief of the Florentine journal La nazione.

2. On Antonio Mordini, see Notebook 7, §58, n. 4.

On Francesco Crispi, see Notebook i, §43, n. 10.

3. The consorteria (i.e., cabal) was the loose political formation, or web of unstable alliances, produced by the split within the Right in the 1860s between the Piedmontese bloc and fractious members or small groups whose politics were guided for the most part by regional, local, and even personal affiliations and interests.

§6. Jacobinism
1. Alexandre Philippe Andryane, Memorie di unprigioneio di Stato allo Spielberg, ed.Rosolino Guastalla [Firenze: Barbèra/ 1916), p. 214. The emphasis of "used to be" is Gramsci's. See also Notebook 1, §44, n. 44.

Alexandre Philippe Andryane (1797-1863), a French member of the secret society of the carbonari, was arrested by the Austrian police in 1823. He was imprisoned for nine years in the Spielberg fortress, where he shared a cell with Federico Confalonieri. His two-volume Mémoires d'un prison-nier d‘Etat was published in Paris in 1837-1838.

§7. Journalism
i・ See "Stampa nostra" [Our press) in Annali dell Italia cattolica, ed. Central Committee of Italian Catholic Action [Milan: Vita e Pensiero, 1926), pp. 435-90； the quoted passage is on p. 435. Gramsci had a copy of this volume of the Catholic annual publication, and it is preserved among the books he had during his time in prison.

2. See Silvio Benco, "Il piccolo" di Trieste: Mezzo secolo di giornalismo [Milan: Treves-Treccani-Tumminelli, 1931). Gramsci requested and received a copy of this book when he was at Turi； see his letters of January 5, 1932, and May 9, 1932/ to Tatiana Schucht.

The Trieste daily II piccolo was launched in 1881 by Teodoro Mayer (1860-1942), its owner and editor-in-chief, who supported the claim that Trieste was a part of "unredeemed" Italy. The paper was suppressed at the outbreak of the World War but resumed publication in 1919, and Mayer was later appointed to the senate by Mussolini.

3. Founded by Edoardo Sonzogno in 1866, the Milan daily II secolo became the most widely circulated newspaper in Italy until it was overtaken by the Corriere della sera around the turn of the century. Initially critical of fascism, Il secolo shifted to a profascist position in 1923.'

4. On the Popular Party, see Notebook 1, §38, n. 5

§8. Catholic Action. Catholic periodical publications
1. All these figures represent Gramsci^ own calculations (with some inaccuracies) based on data culled from "Stampa nostra” (Our press) in Annali deiritalia cattolica, ed. Central Committee of Italian Catholic Action (Milan: Vita e Pensiero, 1926), pp. 435-90. The same figures were written down at the end (p. 67V)of a section of the manuscript of Notebook 9 that Gramsci had originally set aside for translation exercises. See Notebook 9/ Description of the Manuscript.

2. These numbers are Gramsci's calculations based on the information in two sections一”Le diocesi d'Italia” (Italian dioceses) and "Le giunte diocesane d'Italia" (Diocesan councils in Italy)一of the Annali dell'Italia cattolica, pp. 401-27.

§9. The absence of national-popular characteristics in Italian literature
1. Quoted from a review of Umberto Barbaro's novel Luce fredda by Paolo Milano in Ultalia letteraria 3, no. 52 (December 27, 1931). The emphases and parenthetical interjections in the second sentence are Gramsci's.

2. On Giovanni Verga, see Notebook 1, §43, n. 28.

3. Renato Fucini (1843-1921), also known by his pseudonym Neri Tan-fucio, wrote short stories that portray the vicissitudes of life among simple folk in a rural environment. The dialect of Pisa and the common spoken idiom of Tuscany are a prominent feature of Fucini's writings, including his poetry.

§10. Risorgimento. Cavour's realism
i. Gramsci is alluding to an episode recorded in Ferdinando Martini's memoirs； Confessioni e ricordi, 1859-1892 (Milan: Treves, 1928). On this book, of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi, see Notebook 3, §38, n. 5； see also Notebook 6, §89 and §114.

i. On the neo-Guelphs, see Notebook 1, §38； n. 3.

On the Popular Party, see Notebook 1, §38, n. 5.

§12. Popular literature. Bibliography
i. All the information in this note is extracted from a bibliographical survey by Edmond Jaloux in the "Esprit des livres" section of Les nou-velles littéraires 10, no. 458 (July 25, 1931).

§13. Past and present. Manzoni dialectician
i. For an English translation (slightly modified here) of the entire episode； see chapter 8 of Alessandro Manzoni, The Betrothed, trans. Bruce Penman (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 143-65； the quotation is modified from p. 148.

It is not entirely clear whether Gramsci had his own copy of Manzoni's I promessi sposi at Turi, but copies of the novel would have been available from the prison library or fellow prisoners.

§14. Cultural topics
i. Gramsci's source of information on the instructions for preachers contained in De predicatore verbi Dei was an article by Federico Chabod, "Giovanni Boterò/7 Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 4, no. 5 (September-October 1932): 251-84； see, in particular, p. 268 n. 1.

§15. Catholic testimonies
1. "Il regno di Dio secondo alcuni filosofi moderni” (The kingdom of God according to some modern philosophers). La civiltà cattolica 83/ no. i (January 2, 1932): 30-40； the quoted passage is on p. 40.

2. On the effort to portray Thomas Aquinas as Italy怎"national philosopher/7 see Notebook 5, §120, and n. 1 there.

§16. Past and present. Gentile's philosophy
1. Although it is unlikely that Gramsci read Giuseppe Attilio Fanelli's attack on Gentile in the regional weekly Roma fascista of October 18, 1931, he was certainly able to follow the controversy it provoked through the major periodicals that he received and read regularly； see, for example, La nuova Italia 2, no. 11 (November 20, 1931): 458； Critica fascista 9, no. 21 (November i, 1931): 404-5, and 9, no. 24 (December 15, 1931)： 479； and Educazione fascista 9, no. 10 (October 20, 1931): 961-64.

Giuseppe Attilio Fanelli (b. 1895) was a prominent voice of the traditionalist, antimodern, and monarchist wing of the Fascist movement. Editor-in-chief of the periodical II secolo fascista (which appeared between 1931 and 1935), he expounded his ultraconservative views in a number of books, including Dalla insurrezione fascista alla monarchia integrale (Rome: Stamperia Reale, 1925) and Contra Gentiles: Mistificazioni dell'idealismo attuale nella rivoluzione fascista (Rome: Biblioteca del Secolo Fascista, 1933). Another book of Fanelli's attracted Gramsci's attention, namely, Lartigianato: Sintesi di un'economia corporativa (Rome: SPES, 1929)； see Notebook 5, §140, and n. 1, there.

2. See Notebook 6, §82, and n. 5 there.

§17. Past and present
i. Gramsci is alluding to a famous saying often attributed to Hegel. Referring to those who would diminish or qualify the stature of great men, Hegel pours scorn on:

the so-called "psychological" view, which一serving the purpose of envy most effectually一contrives so to refer all actions to the heart一to bring them under such a subjective aspect—as that their authors appear to have done everything under the impulse of some passion, mean or grand—some morbid craving一and on account of these passions and cravings to have been not moral men. Alexander of Macedon partly subdued Greece, and then Asia； therefore he was possessed by a morbid craving for conquest. He is alleged to have acted from a craving for fame, for conquest； and the proof that these were the impelling motives is that he did that which resulted in fame. What pedagogue has not demonstrated of Alexander the Great— f Julius Caesar一that they were instigated by such passions, and were consequently immoral men?—whence the conclusion immediately follows that he, the pedagogue, is a better man than they, because he has not such passions； a proof of which lies in the fact that he does not conquer Asia—vanquish Darius and Porus—but while he enjoys life himself lets others enjoy it too. These psychologists are particularly fond of contemplating those peculiarities of great historical figures which appertain to them as private persons. Man must eat and drink； he sustains relations to friends and acquaintances； he has passing impulses and ebullitions of temper. 〃No man is a hero to his valet-de-chambre,n is a well-known proverb； I have added—and Goethe repeated it ten years later—"but not because the former is no hero, but because the latter is a valet. 〃 He takes off the hero's boots, assists him to bed, knows that he prefers champagne, &c. Historical personages waited upon in historical literature by such psychological valets, come poorly off； they are brought down by these their attendants to a level with—or rather a few degrees below the level of—the morality of such exquisite discerners of spirits. (G.W. F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, trans. J. Sibree [New York: Dover, 1956], pp. 31-32)

2. The section of the Communist Manifesto ("Bourgeois and Proletariansz,) that points to the revolutionary achievements of the bourgeoisie was among the texts that Gramsci translated into Italian from a German anthology of the writings of Marx and Engels. See the Description of the Manuscript of Notebook 7.

Marx and Engels wrote:

The bourgeoisie, historically; has played a most revolutionary part. ... The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionists so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids； Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals； it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades. .. . The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years； has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. [The Communist Manifesto, intro. E. Hobsbawm [London: Verso, 1998], pp. 37-40)

§18. Past and present. Lawyers in Italy

i. All the data in this note are extracted from Mariano D'Amelio's article "La classe forense in cifre(The legal profession in statistics), in the Corriere della sera of January 26, 1932, which does not, however, contain any direct reference to Pietro Calamandrei^ book on the excessive number of lawyers, Calamandrei^ Troppi avvocati! which Gramsci must have seen or learned about from another source, was published in Florence in 1921 by the publishing house of La voce in its book series "Quaderni della voce/7 The series was edited by Giuseppe Prezzolini, and Calamandrei^ book is volume 46 in the fourth series.

§19. Common sense

i. In Alessandro Manzoni, The Betrothed, trans. Bruce Penman [London: Penguin, 1972), this sentence is on p. 603, but the phrase "senso comunein the original Italian text is translated as "general opinion." On Gramsci's access to Ipromessi sposi, see Notebook 8, §13, n. 1.

§20. Risorgimento. The Tuscan Moderates

1. The text of Mario Puccioni's lecture "Uomini del Risorgimento in Toscana” (The men of the Risorgimento in Tuscany), first published in Miscellanza storica della Valdelsa, was reproduced in abridged form in the "Marginalia" section of II marzocco 36, no. 46 (November 15, 1931). The quotations in this note are from II marzocco) all the parenthetical interjections and the emphases are Gramsci's.

On Mario Puccioni, see Notebook 6, §2, n. 2.

2. Ubaldino Peruzzi (1822-91) was a member of the provisional government installed in Tuscany in 1859 following the popular revolt that compelled the grand duke, Leopold II, to flee. He was a strong advocate of national unification and played an important role in the incorporation of Tuscany into the Kingdom of Italy. Peruzzi was named minister of public works in the first Italian national government, which was constituted in March 1861, with Cavour as prime minister. A member of parliament for thirty years, he held a number of ministerial positions and was named senator in 1890.

§21. The Modern Prince

i. Gramsci employs the phrase /z mo derno Principe" [with "moderno" lowercased and "Principe" capitalized) in two ways: |a) as the title of a book that he is thinking of writing and that he conceives as the modern analogue of Machiavelli's Prince一in such instances, it is here rendered as "Modern Prince”； (b) as the political party (specifically, the Communist Party) that he conceives as the collective modern analogue of Machiavelli's figure of the prince—in such instances, it is here rendered as "modern Prince."

2. Georges Sorel expounded his theory of the general strike as the enabling myth of political action in Reflections on Violence, most particularly in the chapter "The Proletarian Strike,〃 where he wrote, among other things:

Experience shows that the framing of a future, in some indeterminate time, may, when it is done in a certain way, be very effective, and have very few inconveniences； this happens when the anticipations of the future take the form of those myths which enclose with them all the strongest inclinations of a people, of a party or of a class, inclinations which recur to the mind with the insistence of instincts in all the circumstances of life； and which give an aspect of complete reality to the hopes of immediate action by which, more easily than by any other method, men can reform their desires, passions, and mental activity....

A knowledge of what the myths contain in the way of details which will actually form part of the history of the future is then of small importance； they are not astrological almanacs....

The myth must be judged as a means of acting on the present； any attempt to discuss how far it can be taken literally as future history is devoid of sense. It is the myth in its entirety which is alone important: its parts are only of interest in so far as they bring out the main idea....

Thanks to [men who have taken a very active part in the real revolutionary movement amid the proletariat] we know that the general strike is indeed what I have said: The myth in which Socialism is wholly comprised, i.e., a body of images capable of evoking instinctively all the sentiments which correspond to the different manifestations of the war undertaken by Socialism against modern society. (G. Sorelz Reflections on Violence, trans. T. E. Hulme and J. Roth [Glencoe, Ill., Free, 1950], pp. 142-45}

4. On "the hundred cities" and the cities of silence/1 see Notebook 1, §43, nn. 4 and 5.

§22. History of the intellectuals. Starting points for research
i. Gramsci transcribed the quotation from Suetonius's Life of Julius Caesar from an article by Cornelio De Marzio, "Note sulla tredicesima confederazione: Professioni ed arti" (Notes on the thirteenth confederation: The professions and the arts), in Gerarchia 11, no. 12 (December 1931): 970-76. This article prompted some of the points made in this note.

The quoted sentence from Suetonius occurs in a passage wherein the Roman historian describes the measures taken by Julius Caesar to slow down a general drain of the population, as well as to encourage doctors and learned men already in Rome to stay and possibly entice others to move there: "To keep up the population of the city, depleted as it was by the assignment of eighty thousand citizens to colonies across the sea, he made a law that no citizen older than twenty or younger than forty, who was not detained by service in the army, should be absent from Italy for more than three successive years. . . . He conferred citizenship on all who practiced medicine, and on all teachers of the liberal arts, to make them more desirous of living in the city and to induce them to resort to it” (Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars, trans. J. C. Rolfe [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1951], 1:58-59).

§23. Federico Gonfalonieri

2. The preface (pp. v-xii) to Alexandre Philippe Andryane, Memorie di un prigione]。di Stato allo Spielberg, ed. Rosolino Guastalla (Firenze: Barbèra, 1916), is the source of the bibliographical references recorded by Gramsci in this note.

On Alexandre Andryane, see Notebook 8, §6, n. 1.

3. See Silvio Pellico, Le mie prigioni, ed. R. Guastalla (Livorno: Giusti, 1912).

Silvio Pellico (1789-1854) was the editor of the biweekly II conciliatore (cofounded by Federico Gonfalonieri in 1818), which was suppressed by the Austrian authorities in October 1819. A year later, Pellico, who had joined the carbonari, was arrested, The notorious prosecutor Antonio Salvo tti forced him to confess, and he was condemned to death. His sentence was commuted, and in 1822 he was sent to the Spielberg prison, where he spent eight years. After his release, Pellico renounced his liberal ideals, refrained from politics, and devoted himself to writing. Le mie prigioni, an account of his prison experiences, was first published in 1832.

4. See Giorgio Pallavicino Trivulzio, Spilbergo e Gradisca: Scene del carcere duro in Austria [Turin: Stamperia delFUnione, 1856). Palla vicino^ account of his experiences in the Austrian prisons was subsequently included in his posthumously published Memorie, 3 vols. (Turin: Loescher, 1882-95).

10. Cesare Cantù (1804-95) produced, among many other things, an enormous Storia universale (Universal history) that appeared in numerous editions, some of them consisting of over fifty volumes. Benedetto Croce wrote about Cantù's massive history in his Storia della storiografia italiana nel secolo decimonono, 2 vols. (Bari: Laterza, 1930)； see, in particular, 1:204-14. Croce compared Cantù's work to a piece of furniture that is passed on from generation to generation and to the kind of still-life painting that one sees hanging on the walls of dining rooms.

13. Gramsci seems to be referring to Croce's essay "Intorno alle condizioni presenti della storiografia in Italia" (On the current situation of historiography in Italy) that was published in four parts in La critica 27, nos. 1-4 (January, March, May, June 1929) and later reproduced as an appendix in the second edition (1930) of his Storia della storiografìa italiana nel secolo decimonono. Croce, however, does not discuss Luzio's work in this essay.

§24. History of the intellectuals
I. See Gaetano Mosca, Elementi di scienza politica, 2d ed. (Turin: Bocca, 1923). Although this is not among the books of Gramsci's that have been preserved, there can be little doubt that he had a copy of it, at least during some of the time he was at Turi. He quotes it directly and at length in §36 of this notebook. For an English translation, see Gaetano Mosca, The Ruling Class, ed. Arthur Livingston, trans. Hannah D. Kahn (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1939).                       .

Gaetano Mosca (1858-1941), a professor of law at his alma materz the University of Palermo and subsequently at the universities of Rome and Turin, is best remembered for his sociopolitical theory of elitism or, more precisely, of elite rule. ''In all societies/7 he wrote in his most influential book. The Ruling Class, "two classes of people appear—a class that rules and a class that is ruled. The first class, always the less numerous, performs all political functions, monopolizes power, and enjoys the advantages that power brings, whereas the second, the more numerous class, is directed and controlled by the first . . . and supplies the first, in appearance at least, with material means of subsistence and with the instrumentalities that are essential to the vitality of the political organism" (p. 50). Mosca was elected to parliament in 1908, served as undersecretary for the colonies between 1914 and 1916, and was named senator for life in 1919. Though by no means a promoter of liberal democracy and rather contemptuous of the principle of universal suffrage, Mosca was critical of Fascism, despite the fact that its theorists and apologists appropriated and made instrumental use of his work.

2. On Vilfredo Pareto, see Notebook 4, §18, n. 6.

§25. Risorgimento

1. What Gramsci calls Quinet's "formula" is stated most succinctly on the very first page of Edgar Quinet's Les revolutions dfItalie (Paris: Cha-merot, 1848-52)； the summary, placed directly under the heading of the opening chapter, includes the following point: 〃Ses révolutions sont de restaurations/7 Quinet also wrote: "Cette révolution communale qui, partout ailleurs en Europe, s'appelle affranchissement, innovation, s'appelle en Italie restauration/, (p. 7).

The historian, poet, and political philosopher Edgar Quinet (1803-75) was stripped of his professorship at the Collège de France in 1846 when the ruling establishment could no longer tolerate the controversies he provoked with his critiques of religion and his exaltation of revolutionary principles. An enthusiastic supporter of the 1848 revolution, he fled France three years later when Louis-Napoleon seized power. Quinet returned to France in 1870 and was elected to parliament shortly afterward.

2. See Daniele Mattalia, "Gioberti in Carducci: Per una maggiore determinazione delle fonti storiche della cultura carducciana” (Gioberti in Carducci: For a more precise determination of the historical sources of Carduccian culture), La nuova Italia 2, no. 11 (November 20, 1931)： 445~ 49； see especially p. 448. This was the first part of an article that was continued in the next two issues of La nuova Italia: 2, no. 12 (December 20, 1931): 478—83； and 3, no. 1 (January 20, 1932): 22-27.

§27. Conservation and innovation
1. It appears that Gramsci's return to the topic of §25, above, is prompted by his reading of the second part of Daniele Mattalia^ article, /zGioberti in Carducci: Per una maggiore determinazione delle fonti storiche della cultura carducciana” (Gioberti in Carducci: For a more precise determination of the historical sources of Carduccian culture), La nuova Italia 2, no. 12 (December 20, 1931): 478-83.

2. On Vincenzo Gioberti, see Notebook i, §46/ n. 1.

3. Gramsci is echoing views he had expressed many years before in an article he first published with the title "L'utopia russa” (The Russian utopia) in II grido del popolo, July 20, 1918. The article was almost entirely blacked out by the censor, but Gramsci was able to reprint it under the title "Utopia" in the Avanti! issue of July 25, 1918/ and again (under the original title) in the Grido del popolo of July 27, 1918. In that article, Gramsci wrote:

History is not a mathematical calculation； it does not possess a decimal system, a progressive enumeration of equal quantities amenable to the four basic operations, the solution of equations and the extraction of roots. Quantity (economic structure) turns into quality because it becomes an instrument for action in men's hands一men whose worth is to be seen not only in terms of their weight, their size, and the mechanical energy they derive from their muscles and nerves, but in the fact that they have a mind, that they suffer, understand, rejoice, desire, and reject. In a proletarian revolution, the unknown variable "humanity" is more mysterious than in any other event. (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from Political Writings: 1910-1920, ed. Quintin Hoare, trans. J. Mathews [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990], pp. 48-49)

8. Francis I (1777-1830), who became king of the Two Sicilies in 1825, was known to have liberal leanings before inheriting the Bourbon crown. Once enthroned, however, he became increasingly intolerant and repressive.

§33. The 1848-49 historical nexus. The federalism of Ferrari一 Cattaneo
i. That is, the rebellion against Austrian rule that took place in Milan between the eighteenth and twenty-second of March 1848.

Carlo Cattaneo and Giuseppe Ferrari, linked by Gramsci in the title of this note, were preeminent exponents and promoters of the idea of Italy as a democratic federal republic. They both regarded the 1848 revolutions as concrete expressions of the struggle for democracy.

§41. Intellectuals

i. Valeria Benetti Bmnelli's II rinnovamento della politica nel pensiero del secolo XVin Italia (Turin: Paravia, 1927) was reviewed by Felice Battaglia in Leonardo 4, n. 5-6 (May 20-June 20, 1928): 175-76. It is quite possible, though, that Gramsci learned about it from another source.

§42. France一Italy

§43. Machiavelli
i. Niccolò Machiavelli, The Art of War, ed. and trans. Christopher Lynch (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), p. 164. Gramsci probably derived this quotation from Luigi Russo, Prolegomeni a Machiavelli (Florence: Le Monnier, 1931). Gramsci asked for Russo's book to be sent to him in his letter of November 23/ 1931； to Tatiana Schacht, and it is preserved among the books he had at Turi.

§44. A collection of Machiavellian maxims
1. Ugo Foscolo, Dei sepolcri, lines 156-58.

On Ugo Foscolo and Dei sepolcri, see Notebook 5, §32, n. 1.

§45. Encyclopedic notions. Commanding and obeying
1. In the Constitutions (1554) of the Society of Jesus, the phrase 〃per・ inde ac cadaver” (just like a corpse) describes the degree of obedience and self-abnegation expected of members of the order.

2. Gramsci is here echoing a passage in Karl Marx's Capital (book i, part 4, chap. 13): “All directly social or communal labour on a large scale requires, to a greater or lesser degree, a directing authority, in order to secure the harmonious co-operation of the activities of individuals, and to perform the general functions that have their origin in the motion of the total productive organism, as distinguished from the motion of its separate organs. A single violin player is his own conductor: an orchestra requires a separate one. The work of directing, superintending and adjusting becomes one of the functions of capital, from the moment that the labour under capital's control becomes co-operative(Karl Marx, Capital, vol. iz trans. Ben Fowkes [London: Penguin, 1976], pp. 448-49).

§47. American blacks
i. Gramsci transcribed this quotation from Beniamino De Ritis, ^Colonie a contanti?” (Colonies in cash?), Corriere della sera, February 18, 1932. This is a translation of De Ritis's rendition of a passage from an article by Stephen Leacock that appeared in the magazine section of the New York Herald Tribune of January 17, 1932.

Stephen Leacock (1869-1944), a professor of economics at McGill University in Canada, wrote numerous books on various topics, among them, Back to Prosperity: The Great Opportunity of the Empire Conference (New York: Macmillan, 1932) and The British Empire: Its Structure, Its Unity, Its Strength (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1940).

§48. Machiavelli. The Modern Prince
i. See Luigi Russo, Prolegomeni a Machiavelli (Florence: Le Monnier, 1931). Gramsci received a copy of this book at Turi sometime between December 1931 and January or February 1932.

4. See Benedetto Croce, Storla dltalia dal i8ji al 1915, 3d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1928), of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi.

In the passage that Gramsci refers to, Croce writes:

There was . . . the contention that Italy after 1870 fell short of her programme and of her true mission, and that she failed to justify her rebirth or to rise to her promised heights, thus proving herself to be mediocre rather than great. What her "true mission" was, remained for the most part unexplained. Some defined it as the duty of promoting and achieving the salvation of all the oppressed nations of the earth, because she herself had been numbered among the oppressed； others, because she had overthrown the temporal power of the Popes, saw it as the liberation of the world from the spiritual yoke of the Catholic Church, and the creation of a new religion of humanity； others again would have had her found a third Rome/7 rivaling both ancient and Christian Rome as ruler of the world, and surpassing them in the domain of thought and achievement. These were but echoes and survivals of the aspirations and beliefs formerly associated with the names of Mazzini, Garibaldi, Gioberti and other leaders of the Risorgimento. Theodor Mommsen once, in a moment of excitement, asked Quintino Sella, "What are you going to do with Rome? It is making us all anxious. Rome is never without cosmopolitan projects/7 To this Sella replied that the cosmopolitan project which Italy then entertained for Rome was /zknowledgeThe story throws light upon the origins of an error of judgment common to writers of romantic history, who make imaginative generalizations about the past and assign peculiar missions to the various nations. . . . What should be attacked is the idea itself that nations are charged with ^peculiar missions.” (Benedetto Croce, A History of Italy: 1871-1915, trans. Cecilia M. Ady [New York: Russell and Russell, 1963], pp. 3—4)

In the note to this passage, Croce writes: "The conversation between Mommsen and Sella is mentioned by A. Guiccioli, Quintino Sella (Rovigo, 1887-8), i. 353. This is not the place in which to enter into details about the 'missions' which the various nations ascribed to themselves in the course of the nineteenth century, although the mission assigned to Germany as the leader of the liberal movement by the liberal Gervinus ... may be mentioned as a curiosity. A. Labriola had already issued a warning against the fantastic comparisons which promoted the opinion that 'Italy had failed to come up to expectations'" (ibid., pp. 290-91).

5. These sentences that Gramsci is quoting secondhand appeared originally in an unsigned article entitled "Torino ^unificatrice^ (Turin the unifier) published in the Neapolitan daily LfItalia of December 22, 1864. The article was subsequently attributed to Francesco De Sanctis by Giuseppe Ferrarelli and Benedetto Croce, both of whom published editions of some of De Sanctis's writings. The article is now included in the edition of De Sanctis's complete works； see Opere di Francesco De Sanctis, vol. 15, Il Mezzogiorno e lo stato unitario, ed. Franco Ferri (Turin: Einaudi, i960), pp. 407-9. Gramsci, however, found the quotation in an article by Paolo Orano, "De Sanctis giornalistan (De Sanctis as journalist) that appeared in the Corriere della sera of March 28, 1934. At some point after the publication of Orano's article, Gramsci inserted the quotation from De Sanctis at the end of this note, the rest of which had been written at least two years earlier. Orano's article is preserved among the newspaper cuttings that Gramsci kept during his years in prison.

On Francesco De Sanctis, see Notebook 1, §96/ n. 3.

§50. Encyclopedic notions. Epigoni and Diadochi
i. In Greek mythology, the famous champions known as the Seven against Thebes led the army that assaulted the city in order to install Poly-nices as king. They were defeated, and all but Adrastus died. Ten years later, the sons of the Seven, called the Epigoni, led by Adrastus, again attacked Thebes and destroyed it.

2 The term "Diadochi” (literally, "successors") refers to those of Alexander the Great's officers who, following his death, partitioned his empire and ruled over its various parts； they include Antigonus, Antipater, Cas-sander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus.

§51. Risorgimento

i. Gramsci's source is Alessandro Levi, Z/I1 pensiero politico di Giuseppe Ferrari(Giuseppe Ferrari's political thought), Nuova rivista storica 15, no. 3-4 (May-August 1931): 217-58； the quotation is from p. 253.

On Bertrando Spaventa, see Notebook 4, §56, n. 5.

§54. Past and present. Sardinia

1. The three articles by Francesco Coletti that appeared in the Corriere della sera are: "Un'isola che risorge: La potenzialità della razza sarda" |A resurgent island: The potential of the Sardinian people), January 10, 1932； 〃La Sardegna che risorge: Redenzione agraria e sviluppo demografico” (Resurgent Sardinia: Agrarian revitalization and demographic growth), February 12, 1932； and 〃La Sardegna risorge: La grande opera che si compie” (Sardinia resurges: The great work that is being accomplished), February 20, 1932.

2. In one of his early articles, "Il Mezzogiorno e la guerra” (The South and the war), in II grido del popolo, April 1, 1916, Gramsci had referred to one of Coletti's studies on Italian development and demography and described him as serious economist who does not indulge in paradoxes/7 At Turi, Gramsci also had a copy of one of Coletti^ books on Italian demography, Studi sulla popolazione italiana in pace e in guerra (Bari: Laterza, 1923)； the volume is preserved among Gramsci's books.

Francesco Coletti (1866-1940), a professor of statistics at the University of Sassari and later at the University of Pavia who spent many years in Sardinia, studied and wrote extensively on the economic conditions and major social issues of the island. He also produced important studies on emigration.

§56. Machiavelli. The Modern Prince
1. See Notebook 7/ §39.

2. Gramsci's source of information on the views of the German general Helmuth von Moltke (1848-1916) on the characteristics of military plans has not been traced.

§58. Machiavelli
i. Gramsci's source here is Benedetto Croce's observation in Conversazioni critiche, 2d ser. (Bari: Laterza: 1918): "With good reason, Schopenhauer compared political education as imparted by Machiavelli to that provided by the fencing master； who does indeed teach the art of killing but does not teach one to become a cutthroat or an assassin" (p. 79). Gramsci had a copy of this collection of essays at Turi.

§59. Popular literature
i. Commenting on Giambattista Marchesi^ book on the eighteenthcentury Italian novel； Croce writes:

Is it worth studying these second-rate works that later generations are likely to forget utterly? Yes, certainly. While there is good reason to exclude such a large volume of material from literary history, it is also true that the exclusion is done quite summarily, as in military court, following public opinion or allowing oneself to be guided by a certain intuition that is by and large sagacious. This generates the desire to reconsider the process, to rectify some possible injustice, to make sure that the exclusion is truly justified. Besides, that crude and disjointed body of work is nevertheless a document of history； it evinces tendencies, predilections, states of mind of past generations； and it provides information on events and customs； it sheds light on the history of civilization and thus even provides clues that converge to explain the things that preceded the great works of literature. {Conversazioni critiche, 2d ser. [Bari: Laterza, 1918], p. 238)

§60. Types of periodicals. Book reviews
i. See Notebook 8, §57.

§61. Machiavelli
1. On the z/dialectic of distincts/7 see Notebook 4, §56, n. 3.

2. For Croce's critique of the Marxist conception of the structure as a noumenon and a hidden god and Gramsci's lengthy discussion of it in a letter to Tatiana Schucht, see Notebook 7, §1, n. 2.

3. From the first of the "Theses on Feuerbach”: "Feuerbach wants sensuous objects, really distinct from conceptual objects, but he does not conceive human activity itself as objective activity. In Das Wesen des Christenthums [The Essence of Christianity], he therefore regards the theoretical attitude as the only genuinely human attitude, while practice is conceived and defined only in its dirty-Jewish [schmutzig-jüdisch] form of appearance. Hence he does not grasp the significance of Revolutionary/ of practical-critical activity" (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 5, 1845-1847 [New York: International, 1975], p. 6). This is among the selections from Marx's writings that Gramsci had translated from the German； see the Description of the Manuscript of Notebook 7.

Gramsci's Italian rendering of the phrase 〃in its dirty-Jewish form of ap-pearance,/ is: "nella sua raffigurazione (sordidamente) giudaica/7 In a letter of March 28, 1932, to his wife, Julia (whose mother was Jewish), Gramsci wrote: 〃I hope you will not misunderstand the expression 'sordidly Jewish7 which I have used above. I remark on this because recently Tania and I have had an epistolary discussion about Zionism and I do not want to be considered 'anti-Semitic' due to those words. But wasn't their author a Jew?” (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:157).

4. Though Gramsci makes specific reference only to The Holy Family, he is probably also thinking of the postface to the second edition of Capital, where Marx writes: "The mystification which the dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general forms of motion in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be inverted, in order to discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell” (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes [London: Penguin, 1976], pp. 103).

Marx makes a similar point in The Holy Family'. "On the one hand, Hegel with masterly sophistry is able to present as a process of the imagined creation of the mind itself, of the Absolute Subject, the process by which the philosopher through sensory perception and imagination passes from one subject to another. On the other hand, however, Hegel very often gives a real presentation, embracing the thing itself； within the speculative presentation. This real development within the speculative development misleads the reader into considering the speculative development as real and the real as speculative" (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 4, 1844-1845 [New York: International, 1975], pp. 60-61).

§62. Machiavelli
1. On Enrico Ferri, see Notebook 1, §25, n. 15. Ferri's major work, Sociologia criminale^ is available in English translation: Criminal Sociology, ed. W. W. Smithers, trans. J. I. Kelly and J. Lisle (New York: Agathon, 1967).

2. On Eugène Sue and the "pillory of virtue" see Gramsci's comment in Notebook 3/ §52.

§63. Catholic Action
1. This compendium of information on Catholic cultural and literary activity in Italy was reviewed by P.C. in UItalia che scrive 15, no. 2 (February 1932): 52-53.

2. On Giovanni Papini, see Notebook 1, §8, n. 1.

§64. Past and present. The Pact of London
1. Italy secretly signed the Pact of London on April 26, 1915, committing itself to join the war on the side of the Entente (Britain, France, and Russia). Article 13 of the pact stated: "Should France and Great Britain extend their colonial possessions in Africa at the expense of Germany, they will admit in principle Italy's right to demand certain compensation by way of an extension of her possessions in Erythraea, Somaliland, and Libya, and the colonial areas adjoining French and British colonies."

The text of the Pact of London is reproduced in its entirety in Antonio Salandra's Lintervento (191^): Ricordi e pensieri (Milan: Mondadori, 1930), pp. 156-60. Gramsci had a copy of this volume of Salandra's memoirs at Turi. This note may also have been prompted by an allusion to Article 13 of the Pact of London in an article by Carlo Calisse, "Mandati internazion-ali〃 (International mandates), Gerarchia 12, no. 6 (June 1932): 457-61.

On the Pact of London, see also Notebook 3, §131, and nn. 1-3 there.

2. Article 2 of the Pact of London states: "On her part Italy undertakes by all means at her disposal to conduct the campaign in union with France, Great Britain, and Russia against all the powers at war with them” (emphasis added). At the same time, however, other articles of the pact do seem to suggest that Italy would be in conflict most directly with Austria. Article I stipulates: 〃A military convention is to be concluded without delay between the General Staffs of France, Great Britain, Russia, and Italy to determine the minimum number of troops which Russia would have to throw against Au s t ri a -H ungary if the latter should want to concentrate all her forces against Italy. Russia should decide mainly to attack GermanyZ7 The focus of Article 3 is similarly on Austria: 〃The naval forces of France and Great Britain are to render uninterrupted and active assistance to Italy until such time as the navy of Austria has been destroyed or peace has been concluded." Italy formally declared war against Austria on May 23, 1915, but refrained from doing the same against Germany until more than a year later, on August 28/ 1916.

On Giovanni Giolitti, see Notebook i, §43, n. 12.

§65. Encyclopedic notions. Bibliography
i. Gramsci obtained the information about Fausto Squillace's Dizionario di sociologiaf rev. ed. (Palermo: Sandron, 1911), from a catalog of the Remo Sandron publishing house.

In addition to two large volumes on sociological theory, Le dottrine sociologiche (Rome: Colombo, 1902) and I problemi costituzionali della sociologia (Palermo: Sandron, 1907), Fausto Squillace (1878-1930) also authored a book on the southern question； La base economica della questione meridionale (Palermo: Sandron, 1905).

§66. History of the subaltern classes. Bibliography
1. As one can see from the list of book titles in this note (and the bibliographic entry in the previous note), Gramsci had in front of him a catalog of the Remo Sandron publishing house.

2. Gramsci's memory is inaccurate. Sandron of Palermo published an Italian translation of selections from Capital, edited by Paul Lafargue, with an introduction by Vilfredo Pareto, in 1894 and reprinted it in 1895. In 1915 the Socialist publishing house Avanti! (based in Milan) brought out a complete Italian edition of volume 1 of Capital, translated from the German by Ettore Marchioli, as volume 7 of the Opere (Works) of Marx, Engels, and Lassalle, edited by Ettore Ciccotti. The first complete Italian edition of Capital一based on the French version reviewed by Marx一was published in Turin in 1886 in the book series z/Biblioteca dell'economista” (The economist's library), directed by Gerolamo Boccardo.

3. Ivanoe Bonomia Le vie nuove del socialismo (The new paths of socialism), which was reprinted many times and exists in various editions, was originally published by Sandron in 1907 in its book series "Biblioteca di scienze sociali e politiche" (Library of political and social sciences).

On Ivanoe Bonomi, see Notebook iz §43, n. 2i.

4. Adolfo Zerboglio (1866-1952), for many years professor of law at the University of Pisa, was named senator in 1924. Best known for his scholarly work on criminal law, Zerboglio was also interested in criminal sociology and delinquency. An admirer of Cesare Lombroso, on whom he wrote a short study, Zerboglio subtitled one of his booklets, L'uomo delinquente (Milan: Alpes, 1925), /zcritical notes of an up-to-date positivist." Il socialismo e le obiezioni più comuni, a response to the most common objections to socialism, was published by Sandron in 1895.

5. Enrico Ferri's booklet on positivist debates concerning socialism. Discordie positiviste sul socialismo (published by Sandron in 1895, with a second edition in 1899), was a polemical response to Raffaele Garofalo's La superstizione socialista (Turin: Roux Frassati, 1895).

On Enrico Ferri, see Notebook i, §25, n. 15.

6. Gerolamo Gatti's tome on socialism and agrarian economics, Agricoltura e socialismo, published by Sandron in 1900, appeared in French as Le socialisms et agriculture (Paris: V. Giare! et E. Brière, 1901), with a preface by Georges Sorel. Gatti is also mentioned in passing by Gramsci in Notebook 8, §36.

7. La fine della lotta per la vita fra gli uomini (The end of the struggle for life among men), by the socialist and labor unionist Giuseppe Emanuele Modigliani (1872-1940)一brother of the renowned artist Amedeo Modigliani—was published by Sandron in 1900.

8. Achille Loria's Marx e la sua dottrina (Marx and his theory) was first published by Sandron in 1902.

On Achille Loria and English translations of his books, see Notebook I, §25, n. i.

9. The first edition of II sindacalismo, by the trade unionist and author of many books on politics and economics Enrico Leone (1875-1940), was published by Sandron in 1906. Leone was also the editor of the journal II sindacato operaio.

10. The full title of Arturo Labriola's book on Marx's theory of value is La teoria del valore di Carlo Marx: Studio sul 3。libro del "Capitale” (Palermo: Sandron, 1899).

On Arturo Labriola, see Notebook 1, §25, n. 15.

11. Enrico Bruni, Socialismo e diritto privato (Palermo: Sandron, 【9。7).

12. Carlo Francesco Ferraris (1850-1924), an economist and politician, taught at the University of Padua, was a member of parliament, served as minister of public works, and became a senator in 1913. He wrote extensively on economics and administrative science, as well as on a broad range of social issues. The second revised and expanded edition of his monograph on historical materialism and the state, 11 materialismo storico e lo stato, was published by Sandron in 1897.

13. A search for this book by Francesco Piccoli has proved fruitless. The title suggests that it is the text of the speech delivered in his own defense by Nicola Barbato一a leader of the peasants' an.d workers' movement known as the Fasci Siciliani一before a military tribunal in Palermo where he stood accused of fomenting the widespread disturbances that erupted in different parts of Sicily in the autumn of 1893. The trial took place in 1894/ in the immediate wake of the violent repression of the movement ordered by Prime Minister Crispi. Barbato was found guilty and condemned to twelve years in prison.

§67. Education
i. Gramsci learned about Carlo Modesto Derada's book on the pedagogical and social reforms brought about by the French Revolution一Gli uomini e le riforme pedagogico-sociali della rivoluzione francese: DalFancien regime alla convenzione (Palermo: Sandron, 1904)一from the same publisher^ catalog that was his source of information for the previous two notes.

§68. Reformation and Renaissance
1. See Domenico Guerri's study of popular cultural currents during the Renaissance, La corrente popolare nel Rinascimento: Berte, burle, baie nella Firenze del Brunellesco e del Burchiello (Florence: Sansoni, 1931).

2. The Italian translation of L. Ponnelle and L. Bordet's book on St. Philip Neri, San Filippo Neri e la società romana del suo tempo: 1515-1595 (Florence: Fiorentina, 1931), was reviewed by Giulio Augusto Levi in La nuova Italia 3, no. 1 (January 20, 1932): 35-36.

3. Giulio Augusto Levi's brief history of aesthetics and taste, Breve storia delFestetica e del gusto, 2d ed. (Milan: Vallardi, 1925), is a seventy-page booklet published as part of a series of literary, historical, and scientific manuals.

In addition to another work on aesthetics, Studi estetici (1907), Giulio Augusto Levi [1879-1951) wrote books on Giacomo Leopardi and Vittorio Alfieri.

4. Levi, review of San Filippo Neri e la società romana del suo tempo, pp. 35-36； all the emphases are Gramsci's.

§69. Machiavelli
i. Gramsci's source on Francis Bacon's characterization of the absolute monarchs is an article by M R. Buccella, 〃I1 mercantilismo come fase della vita storica europea^jMercantilism as a phase of the historical life of Europe), La nuova Italia 3, no. 2 (February 20, 1932): 43-51； see especially, P- 45-

Very close to the end of his History of the Reign of King Henry VII, Francis Bacon wrote of the English monarch that "if a man should compare him with the Kings his concurrents in France and Spain, he shall find him more politic than Lewis the Twelfth of France, and more entire and sincere than Ferdinando of Spain. But if you shall change Lewis the Twelfth for Lewis the Eleventh, who lived a little before, then the consort is more perfect. For that Lewis the Eleventh, Ferdinando, and Henry, may be esteemed for the tres magi of kings of those ages〃 (The Works of Francis Bacon, ed. James Spedding, Robert Leslie Ellis, and Douglas Denon Heath [London: Longmans, 1878], 6:244).

§70. History of the subaltern classes. Bibliography
1. This note is prompted by and contains information derived from an obituary of Filippo Lo Vetere in I problemi del lavoro 6/ no. 2 (February i, 1932)： 13.

Filippo Lo Vetere (1870-1931) joined the Socialist Party when he was a law student at the University of Palermo and took an active role in the formation of the peasants' and workers7 movement known as the Fasci Siciliani. In 1899 he helped found the Consorzio Agrario Siciliano and was elected to serve as its secretary-general. The consortium sought to bring together representatives of landowners, farmers, landless peasants, mine workers, and other social groups in an effort to implement a comprehensive program of reform and modernization in Sicily. Lo Vetere's idealistic attempt to elicit cooperation across class and party lines proved futile and short-lived. It is one of the things he wrote about in the book that Gramsci alludes to, Il movimento agricolo siciliano (Palermo: Sandron, 1903). Problemi siciliani, which Lo Vetere edited, was a monthly that started publication in 1924. Lo Vetere died on July 17, 1932 (not September).

2. On Rinaldo Rigola, see Notebook 7, §13, n. 6.

§72. Past and present. The error of the anti-protectionists of the left
i. La voce was edited by Giuseppe Prezzolini and Unità by Gaetano Salvemini. Going back to the prewar period, both periodicals had a 〃Southemist〃 orientation, and some of their contributors maintained that protectionism was responsible for the economic woes of the South. In his writings both before and after his imprisonment, Gramsci expressed his opposition to protectionism. In his view, it added to the burdens of peasants and workers, making them pay more for the goods they needed, while safeguarding the industrialists' ability to exact high prices for their products. From Gramsci's perspective, antiprotectionists like Prezzolini, Salvemini, and Einaudi were arguing for free trade from within a capitalist order, seeking to make it adhere more closely to classical liberal principles in the interests of the bourgeoisie.

On Giuseppe Prezzolini, see Notebook I, §8, n. 1.

On Gaetano Salvemini, who sometimes used the pseudonym Rerum Scriptor, see Notebook 1, §25, n. 19.

2. See Gaetano Salvemini's book on the old tendencies and new needs of the working-class movement, Tendenze vecchie e necessità nuove del movimento operaio italiano (Bologna: Cappelli, 1922). Although this volume is not among Gramsci's books that have been preserved, there is little doubt that he had a copy of it for some time at Turi. It is listed in the manuscript of Notebook 1 (see Description of the Manuscript) among the books he consigned to his relatives between 1929 and 1930.

§74. Lorianism. E. Ferri
1. Benedetto Croce, Conversazioni critiche, 2d ser. (Bari: Laterza, 1918), p. 314. Gramsci had a copy of this volume of Conversazioni crìtiche at Turi.

The short chapter on Alessandro D'Ancona from which this passage is quoted was originally published as a book review of Ancona's memoir, RL cordi ed affetti (Milan: Treves, 1902), in II marzocco 7, no. 48 (November 30, 1902)，

On Enrico Ferri, see Notebook 1, §25/ n. 15.

2. Gramsci alludes to Ferri's musical "judgment" again in Notebook 9, §I2.

§75. Father Bresciani's progeny. Giulio Bechi
1. Benedetto Croce reviewed Giulio Bechi's novel I seminatori (Milan: Treves, 1914) in the Giornale d'Italia of April 17, 1914, and later included it in his Conversazioni critiche, 2d ser. (Bari: Laterza, 1918), pp. 348-51.

2. On Giulio Bechi and his book on Sardinian banditry, Caccia grossa, see Notebook i, §50, and n. 6 there； Notebook 6, §2； and Notebook 23, §54.

§76. Lorianism
I. It is possible that Gramsci was reminded of Angelo Oliviero Olivetti by some allusion to his Storia critica dellfutopia comunistica (Critical history of the communist utopia), the first volume of which, entitled Psicologia, logica, etica del comuniSmo: Il comuniSmo nel mondo antico (Psychology； logic, ethics of communism: Communism in the ancient world), was published in Rome by the Libreria del Littorio in 1930. Most probably, Gramsci was familiar with Olivetti's publications, such as his fascist treatment of syndicalism, Il sindicalismo come filosofìa e come politica: Lineamenti di sintesi universale (Milan: Alpes, 1924). Before his turn to fascism, Olivetti had been a proponent of Sorellian revolutionary syndicalism, but as editor of the periodical Pagine libere he promoted a version of militant syndicalism that was also nationalist, favoring Italy's war on Libya and its intervention in the Great War.

§77. Lorianism. G.A. Borgese
1. Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, "Psicologia della proibizione^ (Psychology of prohibition). Corriere della sera, March 8, 1932.

Borgese's characterization of war as a conflict over "stolen buckets" is an allusion to the mock heroic poem La secchia rapita by Alessandro Tassoni (1565-1635) about a mighty struggle between citizens of Modena and Bologna over a stolen wooden bucket.

On Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, see Notebook i, §93, n. 2.

2. The comment on historical materialism that Gramsci alludes to here is in Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, Escursioni in terre nuove (Milan: Ceschina, 1931), p. 73. In this booklet, which is an account of his experience at the Seventh International Congress of Philosophy at Oxford in 1930, Borgese also makes some observations on Arthur Stanley Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (New York: Macmillan, 1928). Gramsci had a copy of Borgese's book and of the French translation of Eddington's work, La nature du monde physique (Paris: Payot, 1929)； he cites both of them in Notebook 8, §170.

§78. Machiavelli
1. Physiocracy (i.e., the rule of nature, or the natural order) was the concept at the heart of the economic theory developed, primarily in France, during the second half of the eighteenth century. In contrast to the mercantilists, who placed foreign trade at the center of economic activity and measured wealth in terms of the accumulation of gold and silver, the physiocrats stressed the fundamental importance of agriculture and regarded the rural economy as the determining factor of a nation's wealth. The physiocrats, who some regard as the first economists in the modern sense of the term, had a significant influence on the thought of Adam Smith.

2. Gramsci is referring to an article by Gino Arias, 〃I1 pensiero economico di Niccolò Machiavelli” (Machiavelli^ economie thought), in Annali di economia (Milan: Università Bocconi, 1928), 4:1-31. On this article and Gramsci's related correspondence, see Notebook 6/ §66, n. i.

§79. Machiavelli
i. Gramsci's reflection in this note seems to have been prompted, at least in part, by chapter 10 of The Prince, ,zHow the power of every principality should be measured."

§82. Father Bresciani1 s progeny
i. Gramsci appears to be conflating two novellas from Cervantes's Novelas ejemplares, namely La gitanilla {The Little Gypsy) and La ilustre fregona (The Illustrious Kitchen Maid), both of which have similar resolutions to convoluted plots. Preciosa, the incomparably beautiful young Gypsy in La gitanilla, is pursued by two lovers: Clement, a chivalrous gentleman who writes her delightful madrigals, and Andrew (whose real name is Don Juan), a young nobleman who turns himself into a Gypsy to prove his devotion. Through no fault of their own, they both end up committing murder. Clement is forced to flee Spain, whereas Andrew is released from jail when the aristocratic conegidor of Muncia discovers that Preciosa is in fact his only daughter, who had been abducted by Gypsies when she was a baby. The story ends with a description of the celebrations occasioned by the wedding that bound two noble families together. In La ilustre fregona, two close friends of noble birth, Diego and Thomas, fall hopelessly in love with Costanza, a humble maid at an inn in Toledo. They disguise their true lineage and get humble jobs at the inn in order to be close to their loved one. After many twists and turns in the plot, it turns out that Costanza, too, is of noble birth and is in fact Diego's sister. This allows for the happy ending in which Thomas and Costanza get married—a union of aristocrats.

§83. Past and present. Events of 1917
1. Having entered the war against Austria in May 1915, Italy declared war on Germany during the summer of the following year, on August 28, 1916. The prime minister at the time, however, was Paolo Boselli, not Antonio Salandra, who had resigned in June 1916 after several military setbacks.

On Antonio Salandra, see Notebook i, §43, n. 20.

2. Following Salandrazs resignation, Paolo Boselli (1838-1932), a liberal conservative who had held ministerial positions under three different prime ministers and had supported Italy's entry into the war, was entrusted with forming a government of national unity. The situation did not improve； on the domestic front, protests against the war and the severe privations it brought with it erupted in various parts of Italy, while the military effort continued to flounder, exacerbated by serious occurrences of desertion and mutiny. In early June 1917, three cabinet ministers—Ubaldo Comandini, Leonida Bissolati, and Ivanoe Bonomi一resigned in protest when they learned that the foreign minister, Giorgio Sidney Sonnino, had approved a promise of ^independence under Italian protection" to Albania. At the end of the month, Boselli obtained parliamentary approval of a cabinet reshuffle. On October 16, when parliament reconvened after the summer break, the debate on the budget, on the military situation, and on the government's increasingly severe repressive measures against the antiwar movement revealed the weakness of the Boselli administration, as socialists, Giolittians, and others formed a large, unified oppositional block. Finally, on October 25, the day after the army under the command of Luigi Cadorna was humiliated in Caporetto, an overwhelming vote of no-confidence in parliament dissolved Boselli's government. Vittorio Emanuele Orlando succeeded him as prime minister.

In August 1916/ Giulio Douhet (1869-1930), a colonel at the time, wrote confidential letters to Bissolati and Sonnino that were harshly critical of the war effort and of Cadorna's command in particular. The documents were leaked； Douhet was court-martialed in October and received a one-year sentence. Vindicated by the events of Caporetto, Douhet was subsequently rehabilitated.

5. In the finger-pointing that followed the Caporetto debacle, the primary targets of the establishment were the socialists, who vigorously opposed the war. Pope Benedict XV who actively and persistently sought to end the conflict, and, above all, Giolitti, who had openly advocated neutrality in 1915.

Gramsci had a copy of an earlier book by Giulio Douhet, Probabili aspetti della guerra futura (Palermo: Sandron, 1928).

7. Giacomo Devoto (1897-1974) became one of Italy's most distinguished linguists and lexicographers, as well as president of the Accademia della Crusca. It has not been possible to ascertain whether he was the author of the review of Douhet's book in Leonardo, the cultural monthly edited by Luigi Russo.

8. Giuseppe Canepa, who was indeed in charge of the commissariat for provisions and foodstuffs at the time of the Turin uprisings in August 1917, had actually used the phrase "try and try again" earlier in an interview published in the Roman daily II messaggero on July 4, 1917- An article entitled " Approvigionamenti e consumi” (Provisons and consumption) that appeared in Gaetano Salvemini's Unità on July 17, 1917, commented: 〃in a time of war it is neither prudent nor licit to ztry and try again/ as the Hon. Canepa says./, During the Turin disturbances of 1917, the oppositional press cited Canepa's words as evidence of his insensitivity.

On Giuseppe Canepa, see Notebook i, §116, n. 16.

The Accademia del Cimento, founded in 1657, by Prince Leopold and Grand Duke Ferdinand II de' Medici, adopted the motto provando e riprovando” (to try and try again). Its members, admirers of Galileo, sought to apply the methods of experimental science to the claims of natural philosophy in order to determine their validity. The results were published in Saggi di naturali esperienze (Florence: Giuseppe Cocchini, 1666). The Accademia, del Cimento, considered to have been the first European scientific society, remained active for about a decade.

9. On August ii, 1930, Gramsci wrote to Tatiana Schucht: 〃Do you know that I had to laugh at your remark that you are 'always hungry'? You talk about it as if it were an illness and not a sign of good health. This is a point of view that the Neapolitans have humorously embodied in the figure of Monsignor Perrelli and the care he took of his horses to cure them of the disease of hunger. But at least Monsignor Perrelli was trying to cure his horses and did not apply the regime of abstinence to himself!,z (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 1:345-46).

Annotating this passage, Rosengarten explains: "The reference is to the Neapolitan Catholic prelate Filippo Perrelli (1707-1789), known by the name Monsignor Perrelli to the people of Naples, who made him into a legendary figure around whom turned many humorous anecdotes. One such anecdote described his attempts to cure his horse of excessive hunger by imposing on it a rigorous diet, The diet was so rigorous that the horse died of malnutrition" (ibid., 1:346 n. 2).

Gramsci alludes to Monsignor Perrelli again in another letter to Tatiana Schucht, dated August 10, 1931: "You are my only correspondent for some months now, but I am afraid that if you continue to make dietetic experiments ・..you'll end up like Monsignor Perrelli^ horse〃 (ibid., 2:54).

10. Gramsci had described Paolo Boselli as the "chatterbox of the Italic tradition" in an article he wrote during the war deriding a nationalistic attack on the use of German grammar books for the teaching of Latin in Italian schools； see 〃La difesa dello Schultz” (In defense of Schultz), in the Turin and Milan editions of Avanti! November 27, 1917.

11. In a famous electoral campaign speech he gave at Dronero on October 12, 1917, Giolitti said:

Our internal political structure contains the strangest of contradictions.

While it cannot spend a single lira or modify the administrative system in any way . . . without parliamentary approval, the executive branch can nevertheless negotiate treaties and, in the name of the country, assume the most dreadful obligations that inevitably lead to war. And it can do this without parliamentary approval； indeed, it can do this without the parliament and the nation being informed or even having any way of being informed. This state of affairs must be radically changed by giving parliament the same authority in foreign affairs that it has in domestic and economic policy； in other words, it must be ordained that no international agreement can be entered into, no obligation can be assumed without parliamentary approval. The exclusion of the possibility of secret treaties ensures that the nation will be kept informed about foreign policy and thus be able to make its voice heard and its will prevail at the right time. Furthermore, treaties approved by the people's representatives are much more likely to be observed because the nation's conscience will rebel against their violation. In 1848/ when article 5 of the statute was approved, diplomatic secrecy was the norm in all European states, and wars were fought by professional armies. Now, how-everz the political structures of civil states are radically different； wars have become conflicts between peoples who throw the entire mass of the population under arms against the adversary, using all the means of destruction at their disposal, and the conflict ends only when one of the sides is utterly ruined. There is therefore a genuine historical need to bring international relations under the control of the representatives of the people, for it is only proper that they should be the ones to bear these onerous responsibilities. (Giovanni Giolitti, Discorsi extrapar la-men tari [Turin: Einaudi, 1952], pp. 312-13)

Seven months after the Dronero speech, when the government of Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti was in the midst of a deep political crisis, Giolitti again raised the issue of article 5 of the Statute in an interview published by La tribuna on May 27, 1920:

The general public's respect for parliament is seriously undermined by the complete absence of any legislative activity； since parliament abdicated its powers a long time ago, power is exercised by the government in the form of legal decrees. This nonconstitutional system that has stripped legislative work of every semblance of seriousness must be rejected. The full exercise of legislative authority, control of the public expenditure, and the organization of public services must be restored to parliament, and, furthermore, parliament must be given the same power over foreign policy that it has over domestic and economic policy, which will require the modification of article 5 of the statute and the establishment, in both houses of parliament, of permanent commissions to control foreign policy. (Giolitti, Discorsi extiaparlamentan, pp. 328-29)

12. On Francesco Saverio Nitti, see Notebook 1, §25, n. 12.

13. Nitti resigned on June 9/ 1920, and Giolitti was asked to form a new government, which he did, becoming prime minister for the fifth time on June 15.

15. See Luigi Ambrosini's book on the political orientation of the Popular Party, Fra Caldino alla cerca: Per la coscienza politica dei popolari (Milan: Vitagliano, 1920), of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi.

An article entitled 〃Un presidente” (A president), consisting of a harsh attack on Luigi Ambrosini, published in the Piedmont edition of Avanti! on June 28/ 1920, has been attributed to Gramsci by Sergio Caprioglio. Ambrosini was a supporter of Giolitti at the time and the "presidente” (i.e., chairman) of the executive committee of the League of Consumers； he would later join the Popular Party. On Ambrosini, see also Notebook I, §44/ n. 27.

§84. Machiavelli
i. Apropos of effectual reality” (realtà effetuale), Gramsci wrote to Tatiana Schucht on May 30. 1932:

In Lessons in the History of Philosophy, [Hegel] identified a connection between the French revolution and the philosophies of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling and said that "only two peoples, the German and the French, as opposed as they may be to each other, indeed precisely because they are opposed, participated in the great epoch of universal history" at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, because in Germany the new principle "has erupted as spirit and concept” whereas in France it has expressed itself as /zeffectual reality.n In The Holy Family we see how this connection postulated by Hegel between French political activity and German philosophical activity was appropriated by the theorists of the philosophy of praxis. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:178-79)

Gramsci is also echoing Machiavelli's distinction between the imagined and the real (and between what is and what should be) in the opening paragraph of chapter 15 of The Prince:

It now remains for us to see how a prince should govern his conduct towards his subjects or his friends. I know that this has often been written about before, and so I hope it will not be thought presumptuous for me to do so, as, especially in discussing this subject, I draw up an original set of rules. But since my intention is to say something that will prove of practical use to the inquirer, I have thought it proper to represent things as they are in real truth [verità effettuale], rather than as they are imagined. Many have dreamed up republics and principalities which have never in truth been known to exist； the gulf between how one should live and how one does live is so wide that a man who neglects what is actually done for what should be done learns the way to self-destruction rather than self-preservation. (Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince, trans. George Bull [Harmondsworth, U.K.: Penguin, 1961], pp. 90-91)

3. See Luigi Russo, Prolegomeni a Machiavelli (Florence: Le Monnier, 1931), especially the first chapter, Savonarola e Machiavelli." Gramsci had a copy of this book at Turi.

i. Antonio Marozzi's article "La razionalizzazione della produzione” (The rationalization of production), in Nuova antologia 67, no. 1438 (February 16, 1932): 524-32, was the sixth in a series published under the general heading 〃Le condizioni presenti delFeconomia agricola italiana(The current economic state of agriculture in Italy).

§86. Machiavelli
i. The full resonance of the phrase "dual perspective” (doppia prospettiva), its background, and the crucial issues it was associated with for Gramsci are thoroughly explained by Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith:

The term 11 doppia prospettiva^ goes back to the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern. The Congress followed a long series of defeats for the revolution internationally, culminating in the German October of 1923. Zinoviev, who had succeeded in placing his protégés Fischer and Maslov at the head of the German Party and in laying the blame for the defeat at the door of Brandlcr, who was ousted from the leadership, was anxious to present the entire episode as not being of critical importance, and the German revolution as still being on the cards in the immediate future. Trotsky and Radek were arguing that the European bourgeoisie was moving in the direction of a "labourist" resolution of its post-war political crisis, witness events in England and France. Under Zinoviev's guidance, the Congress in effect adopted a compromise solution, allowing both for the imminence of revolution and for a generalisation of the "labourist" solution. Section XIII of the Theses on Tactics was entitled "Two Perspectives." It stated:

“The epoch of international revolution has commenced. The rate of its development as a whole or partially, the rate of development of revo lutionary events in any particular continent or in any particular country, cannot be foretold with precision. The whole situation is such that two perspectives are open: (a) a possible slow and prolonged development of the proletarian revolution, and (b) on the other hand, that the ground under capitalism has been mined to such an extent and that the contradictions of capitalism as a whole have developed so rapidly, that the solution in one country or another may come in the not distant future.

"The Comintern must base its tactics upon the possibility of both perspectives. The manoeuvres of the Comintern must be so arranged as to be able rapidly to adapt oneself to the changing rate of development, and in any case even with a prolonged rate of development of events, to remain the irreconcilable mass Communist Party of proletarian revolution which attracts the masses and trains them for the revolutionary struggle."

This dual perspective continued to characterise Comintern strategy in the following years； Zinoviev reaffirmed it, for instance, at the Sixth Plenum in early 1926. Although its original formulation by Zinoviev was due to mainly tactical considerations, Gramsci seems to have continued to see it as preferable to the "right" line of 1926-28 and the "left” line of the Third Period, and to have felt that its directives could be generalised for all periods when "frontal attack" was not immediately possible. According to Athos Lisa [who was imprisoned at Turi until March 1933], Gramsci spoke of the 〃two perspectives" during the discussions which took place among the prisoners at Turi. He said that of the two, the more likely was that of some form of transitional stage intervening between the fall of fascism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and that the party's tactics should take this into account. On the other hand, his criticisms here of those who "have reduced the theory of the 'dual perspective' to . . . nothing but two forms of 'immediacy/ etc." are directed against any strategy which separated the moment of force from the moment of consent. (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. Q. Hoare and G. Nowell Smith [New York: International, 1971], p. 16911)

2. In chapter 18 ("How princes should honour their word") of The Prince, Machiavelli wrote:

You should understand, therefore, that there are two ways of fighting: by law or by force. The first way is natural to men, and the second to beasts. But as the first way often proves inadequate one must needs have recourse to the second. So a prince must understand how to make a nice use of the beast and the man. The ancient writers taught princes about this by an allegory, when they described how Achilles and many other princes of the ancient world were sent to be brought up by Chiron, the centaur, so that he might train them his way. All the allegory means, in making the teacher half beast and half man, is that a prince must know how to act according to the nature of both, and that he cannot survive otherwise. (Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince^ trans. George Bull [Har-mondsworth, U.K.: Penguin, 1961], p. 99)

3. Gramsci is alluding to chapter 9, “Stato e chiesa in senso ideale e loro perpetua lotta nella storia” (State and church in the ideal sense and their perpetual conflict in history), in Benedetto Croce's Etica e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1931), of which he had a copy at Turi.

§89. Brief notes on American culture
1. This is not to be confused with the Progressive Party (better known as the Bull Moose party) formed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 after he failed to get the Republican Party nomination for that year's presidential election. The reference here is to the party formed by Robert M. La Follette (a Republican senator from Wisconsin) in 1924. In that year's presidential campaign, La Follette had the support of the Socialist Party of America and of the American Federation of Labor and ended up obtaining 17 percent of the popular vote in the election that resulted in Calvin Coolidge winning a second term. La Follette died the following year, but the Progressive Party remained a significant political force in Wisconsin until the late 1930s. La Follette's son, Philip, for example, won two gubernatorial elections (in 1931 and 1935) running as a Progressive.

§91. Gonfalonieri
1. On Federico Gonfalonieri, see Notebook x, §44/ n. 42.

2. Gramsci transcribed this passage from Silvio D'Amico's "Sulle orme (l'un martirio: Visita alla prigione di Silvio Pellico” (Retracing the footsteps of a martyrdom: A visit to Silvio Pellico's prison), which appeared in the daily newspaper II resto del Carlino of March 16, 1932. The parenthetical interjection is Grams ci zs.

In Silvio D'Amico's book Certezze (Milan: Treves-Treccani-Tumminel-li, 1932), the passage quoted by Gramsci is on p. 212.

3. Gramsci pursues this question in his letter of May 23, 1932, to Tatiana Schucht:

If you happen to write to Piero [Sraffa] tell him that in a passage of a chapter of Silvio D'Amico's recent book Certezze [Certainties], in the chapter devoted to the Spielberg there is mention of an appeal for clemency sent by Federico Confalonieri to the Emperor of Austria, which is supposedly preserved in the Italian Museum of the Spielberg. D'Amico does not reprint this appeal, but he refers to it as the writing of a man reduced to the nth degree of humiliation and abjectness. Perhaps Piero knows whether this appeal by Confalonieri has already been published in some publication about Confalonieri. I don't think that I ever heard any mention of it. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:176)

Almost a decade after Gramsci wrote this letter, Renzo U. Montini published the complete text of three petitions by Confalonieri under the title "Tre suppliche inedite di Federico Confalonieri” (Three previously unpublished petitions by Confalonieri) in Rassegna storica del Risorgimento 29, no. I (January-February, 1942): 83-90.

On Pietro Silva, see Notebook 2. §100. n. 1.

§94. Encyclopedic notions. "Homo homini lupus. ”
i. "Man is a wolf to man, woman is even more of a wolf to woman, and priest is the fiercest of wolves to priest." Gramsci came across this expanded version of the well-known epigram Homo homini lupus in Albert Thibaudet/s "Les mémoires d'Alfred Loisy/7 a review of Loisy's three-volume autobiography Mémoires pour servir à Phistoire religieuse de no tre temps (Paris: E, Nourry, 1930-31), in Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 448 (May 16, 1931).

Homo homini lupus is a slight adaptation of a phrase in Plautus's play Asinaiia (act 2, scene 4, 1. 88). Thomas Hobbes uses it in the dedicatory epistle to the earl of Devonshire in De cive (1651): "To speak impartially, both sayings are very true； that man to man is a kind of God； and that man to man is an arrant wolf.”

§95. Catholic integralists—Jesuits—Modernists
i. The actual title of Alfred Loisy's work is Mémoires pour servir à Phistoire religieuse de notre temps (Paris: E. Nourry, 1930-31).

§99. Past and present
i. Francesco Orestano (1873-1945), born in Palermo, studied law at the university of his native city and philosophy at the University of Leipzig. After completing his studies, Orestano joined the faculty of his alma mater and later moved to the University of Rome. Considered a major fascist intellectual； he was Giovanni Gentile's rival for the unofficial title of philosopher of the Fascist regime. Orestano； who also served as president of the Italian Philosophical Society, was inducted into the Accademia d'Italia in 1929. His earliest writings were on Kant and Nietzsche； later, he claimed to have moved beyond the Kantian notion of critique and formulated what he described as a philosophy of superrealism.

The source of the quotation from II Tevere that Gramsci alludes to has not been traced； neither has the negative characterization of Francesco Orestano been located in II Tevere itself. The Rome newspaper II Tevere, which often functioned as Mussolini's unofficial mouthpiece, was founded in 1924 by Telesio Interlandi (1894-1965), who became one of the most vociferous promoters of Nazi-inspired racist ideology and anti-Semitism. The editorship of II Tevere was subsequently passed on to Giorgio Almi-rante (1914-88), who would later serve as minister of popular culture in the Republic of Salò. After the war, Almirante was a founding member of the neo-Fascist party, Movimento Sociale Italiano.

Corrado Ricci (1858-1934) was the director of the Uffizi galleries and museum in Florence when in 1906 he was appointed Italy's general director of antiquities and the fine arts, charged with overseeing the preservation and restoration of the country's artistic patrimony. Several of his books on architecture and art history have been published in English.

§101. Past and present. Italian parliament
1. On the Albertine Statute, which became the constitution of the unified Kingdom of Italy, see Notebook 5, §70, n. 7.

2. The following extract from Stuart Woolf's History of Italy provides a succinct account of the convoluted political situation and constitutional crisis that developed in the wake of Piedmont's severe defeat by the Austrians in the battle of Novara on March 23, 1849一a defeat that represented a very serious setback in the war for Italian independence and induced the king, Carlo Alberto, to abdicate in favor of his son Vittorio Emanuele—and culminated in the proclamation of Moncalieri:

The survival of the Piedmontese Statute after Novara probably owed more to the traditional anti-Austrian policy of this dynastic state than to any other factor. The new king, Victor Emmanuel II . . . had opposed his father's renewal of the war against Austria, was authoritarian in character, and despised the democratic canaille. But Novara left him with a defeated army； a hostile nobility and senate, Genoa in revolt and a strongly patriotic democratic majority in the lower chamber. The revocation of the Statute would have led to civil war, even to a democratic revolution as in Tuscany or Rome. The king's main hope of regaining prestige and authority for the dynasty lay with [Prime Minister Massimo] D'Azeglio and the moderates, whose anti-Austrian patriotism was by now solidly welded to their belief in constitutionalism. The Statute could be used as a legal and peaceable instrument to curb the democrats, as the king explained to [the Austrian military commander and governor of northern Italy] Radetzky.・..Radetzky's fear of provoking French intervention his (illusory) hopes of pacifying this most turbulent of all Italian states by drawing the young king within the Austrian orbit, explain the extremely lenient armistice he granted this twice-defeated enemy.

The protracted negotiations over a peace treaty revealed the contradictory pressures on the king.... In Piedmont, not only reactionaries ... but even traditional liberals . . . saw an Austrian alliance and the abolition of the Statute as the only solution. But the moderates rallied alongside D'Azeglio..・・ General Dabormida； who was responsible for the negotiations with Austria, was convinced that revocation of the Statute would be catastrophic..,.

The difficulty for DzAzeglio and his colleagues was that the democratic majority in the chamber refused to accept what it regarded as a humiliating peace. D'Azeglio called new elections in July 1849, in which the king appealed to the electorate； the apathy was such that only 30,000 of the 87,000 electorate voted, returning a democratic majority. The king accepted the peace of Milan (6 August 1849) as lay within his powers according to the Statute, but the democrats delayed its ratification.... Constitutional government, as interpreted by D'Azeglio and the king, had become impossible: the hostile majority in the chamber refused to approve the budget for more than a month at a time. Pressure for a coup increased. . . . DzAzeglio appealed constantly to the state of emergency, the ^exceptional times/7 and threatened the opposition with a reactionary government if it did not give support, Finally he dissolved parliament again and stretched the Statute to its limit by issuing in the king's name from [the royal chateau of] Moncalieri a proclamation denouncing the opposition (20 November 1849): "With the dissolution of the chamber of deputies, the liberties of the country are not in any danger. . . . But if the country, if the electors deny me their support, the responsibility for the future will no longer fall upon me.” . . . A massive vote returned a solid moderate majority.

The weakness of D'Azeglio's stand against the democrats was that it blurred the distinction between the constitutional moderates and the reactionaries. It also reinforced the autonomy of the king. (Stuart Woolf, A History of Italy: 1700-1860 [London: Routledge, 1991], pp. 432-34)

3. Gramsci had alluded to Sidney Sonnino's article "Torniamo allo sta-tuto〃 (Return to the statute) in an article, "Il manifesto dei socialisti” (The socialists7 manifesto), he published in L'ordine nuovo of April 13, 1921. His comments on the same article in this note, however, may have been prompted by Benedetto Croce's observations on Sonnino's position concerning the constitution:

Sonnino, who had been a minister under Crispi, believing that Italy was seriously threatened by two dangers, socialism and clericalism, and declaring that he desired neither Caesarism nor any other form of autocracy but only to save the liberal tradition of Italy, pronounced in favor of a "return to the Statute,n that is, the abolition of the parliamentary regime by which ministers were chosen by and dependent on the Chamber, and a return to the system which made them ministers of the sovereign, with the consequent strengthening of the power of the executive. His article, which appeared in the Nuova Antologia (i January 1897), raised discussion, and it implied, in a sense, going beyond Crispi, who had contented himself with extraordinary and temporary measures, whereas Sonnino frankly advocated constitutional reform.

1. Giovanni Papini, "Croce e la croce” (Croce and the cross), Nuova antologia 67, no. 1439 (March i, 1932): 4-21. In this article, Papini criticizes Croce's secularism and liberalism, especially as it manifests itself in his history of Europe after the French Revolution, Storia dnEuropa del secolo decimonono (Bari: Laterza, 1932). Gramsci had already alluded to this article earlier in this notebook, in §98.

On Giovanni Papini, see Notebook i, §8, n. 1.

2. The title of Papini's article is a play on words: croce is Italian for "cross."

§106. Past and present. The Italian language in Malta
1. See the unsigned article "Malta: Per concludere” (Malta: To conclude) in the Corriere della sera of March 25/ 1932. The article discusses a speech by Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, the British secretary of state for the colonies, about restricting the teaching of Italian in Malta and the negative reactions it generated.

2. On the concordat, see Notebook 4, §53/ n. 1.

The language question and the configuration of political parties on the island of Malta were thoroughly intertwined. In 1932 the British colonial rulers agreed to permit elections in Malta under a constitution that gave the country a limited form of self-government. The two major parties contesting the elections were the pro-Italian Nationalist Party and the pro-British Constitutional Party. The Nationalists won in a landslide, and the following year Britain revoked the constitution. Although the lingua franca on the island has always been Maltese, for centuries the dominant cultural influence in Malta, after the Catholic Church, was Italian, and the two were, for the most part, inseparable. The advent of British rule obviously favored the spread of English and greatly increased exposure to British culture. Nonetheless, Italian remained the formal language used in the law courts and in ecclesiastical circles until 1934, when the British colonial minister's decree made English and Maltese (for which a uniform orthographic system had yet to be established) the official languages of the island. At the same time, Italy was trying hard to reinforce Italian culture on the island, especially since the Fascist regime considered Malta part of Italia irredenta (unredeemed Italy). Among other things, it funded the establishment and staffing of the Istituto di Cultura Italiana in the capital, Valletta, which opened with great fanfare in February 1932 with two members of the Accademia d'Italia一Ugo Ojetti and Angiolo Silvio Novaro一as special guests. As part of its promotion of Italian culture in Malta, the Istituto organized lavish events and sponsored numerous visits to the island by Italian artists, musicians, dramatists, and intellectuals, among them, Silvio D'Amico, Francesco Ercole, Arturo Stanghellini, Pericle Ducati, Luigi Orsini, Valentino Piccoli, and Gioacchino Volpe (to mention only those whose names also appear in Gramsci's notebooks). In July 1936, the British rulers of Malta ordered the Istituto to close.

§109. The intellectuals. Church Latin and the vernacular in the Middle Ages
1. Gramsci translated this passage into Italian from Gustave Lanson, His toil e de la litter atme frangaise, 19 th ed. (Paris: Hachette, n.d.), pp. 160-61. The emphasis is Gramsci's. Although this book is not among Gramsci's books that have been preserved, he must have had access to it (and possibly owned a copy of it) at Turi.

2. The bibliographic data recorded here are from a note on p. 160 of Lanson's Histoire.

§110. Journalism. Review of the press
1. On Charles Maurras and Laction fiangaise, see Notebook i, §14, n. 1.

2. “Scampoli” (Remnants, or Scraps) is the general heading under which Giacinto Serrati published his often polemical and sardonic articles in Avanti!

On Giacinto Menotti Serrati, see Notebook i, §116, n. 5.

3. Mario Missiroli wrote a regular column, "Opinion* (Opinions), for the daily newspaper of Bologna, Il resto del Carlino, which he also edited. Close to two hundred of these short pieces were selected by Giuseppe Prezzolini and published as a book: Mario Missiroli, Opinioni (Florence: La Voce, 1921), a copy of which is preserved with the books Gramsci owned before his arrest. Later, Missiroli published a regular column with the same title in La stampa of Turin.

2. In Pagine sulla guerra, rev. ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1928), Benedetto Croce describes Paul Bourget's novel Le disciple as a "masterpiece in reverse” and as 〃a Stendhalian mess ... made stupid by the infusion of a silly sense of moral-philosophical tragedy(p. 188).

On Paul Bourget and his novel Le disciple, see Notebook 3/ §37, n. 4.

§112. History as the history of liberty and liberalism
1. In all probability； Gramsci is referring to the text of what are now the first three chapters ("La religione della libertà," "Le fedi opposte/7 and 〃I1 romanticismo["The Religion of Liberty/' Opposing Religious Faiths’” and "The Romantic Movement/7 respectively]) of Benedetto Croce's Storia d'Europa del secolo decimonono (Bari: Laterza, 1932), first presented in the form of lectures and published in Naples in 1931 as a booklet entitled Capitoli introduttivi di una Storia delVEuropa nel secolo decimonono that was brought out by the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Royal Society of Naples. In a letter dated April 18, 1932, Gramsci informs Tatiana Schuchtz apropos of Croce's Storia dfEuropa: /ZI have already read the book's introductory chapters, because they had appeared in a separate booklet some months ago〃 (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:162). Gramsci would later receive a copy of Croce's Storia d'Europa. For an English translation, see Benedetto Croce, History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century, trans. Henry Furst (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1933).

2. Before his arrest, Gramsci owned six of the seven volumes of Pietro Vigo's documentary record of late-nineteenth-century Italian history, Annali ^Italia: Storia degli ultimi trentanni del secolo XIX (Milan: Treves, 1908-15). He had these volumes sent to him in prison (see his letter to Tatiana Schucht, December 27/ 1926), and he had them at Turi. In this note, Gramsci is alluding to the following observation by Vigo: z/Those who espoused totally anticlerical ideas were called liberals, an appellation that, with the passage of time and the unfolding of events, acquired a broader meaning, so that the term "liberal" came to be applied to anyone who wanted to free public and private life completely from the influence and actions of the church” (1:22).

3. Benedetto Croce's Eternità e storicità della filosofia (Rieti: Bibliotheca Editrice, 1930) is a collection of short articles by Croce that was published as part of the z/Quaderni critici(Critical notebooks) edited by Domenico Petrini. Of special interest is the article "Interpretazione storica delle proposizioni filosofiche" (Historical interpretation of philosophical propositions) that Gramsci alludes to in Notebook io, II, §41.ix. Gramsci asked Tatiana Schucht to send him a copy of this booklet by Croce (see the letter of December i, 1930), and it is preserved with the books he had at Turi.

§113. History of the intellectuals. Humanism
i. See Notebook 1, §122 and §153. Gramsci revisits this topic later in this notebook, in §229.

§114. Machiavelli. Jean Bodin
1. Gramsci extracted this biographical and bibliographical information about Jean Bodin from Gustave Lanson, Histoire de la littérature fran-Qaise, 19th ed. (Paris: Hachette, n.d,), p. 316. When composing this note, Gramsci may also have been looking at Federico Chabod's three-part article “Giovanni Boterò" in Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 4, no. 5 (September-October, 1931): 251-85； 4, no. 6 (November-December,

1931) : 341-69； and 5, no. 1 (January-February, 1932): 19-57.

Each of the three works by Jean Bodin briefly described in this note are available in English: Method for the Easy Coinprehension of History, trans. Beatrice Reynolds (New York: Columbia University Press, 1945)； The Six Bookes of a Cominonweale, ed. Kenneth D. McRae (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1962)； and Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the Sublim切 trans. M.L.D. Kuntz (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press, 1975).

2. Antonio Panella in fact wrote a sequence of eight articles entitled "Gli antimachiavellici" (The anti-Machiavellians) that were published in II marzocco 31, no. 47 [November 21, 1926)； 31, no. 49 (December 5, 1926)； 31, no. 51 (December 19, 1926)； 32, no. 3 (January 16/ 1927)； 32, no. 6 (February 6, 1927)； 32, no. 8 (February 20, 1927)； 32/ no. 10 (March 6,

2. The first Jacobin "clubs”—in effect, small French-inspired clandestine groups of republican and democratic idealists and militants—were formed in the Kingdom of Naples around 1792. Their conspiratorial plans to overthrow the monarchy were quickly thwarted, and many of the leaders were imprisoned or fled to other parts of Italy, such as Lombardy, Liguria, and Rome.

3. On January 6, 1913, government troops fired on agricultural workers who were staging a peaceful demonstration at Roccagorda [in the Lazio region) demanding better living conditions. There were numerous casualties, including seven or eight dead. Around the same time, similar demonstrations in Comiso (Sicily) and Baganzola [Parma) were also violently repressed by government troops. Giovanni Giolitti was prime minister at the time.

4. See part 9 of Adolfo Omodeo's serial publication of "Momenti della vita di guerra: Dai diari e delle lettere dei caduti” (Moments in the life of war: From the diaries and letters of the fallen), in La crìtica 30, no. 1 (January 20, 1932): 27-42； the quotation is from pp. 29-30. This work was later published as a book with the same title (Bari: Laterza, 1934).

Ignazio di Trabia, a Sicilian aristocrat who pursued a military career； was the son of Prince Pietro Lanza di Scalea (1863-1938) of Palermo, who was first elected to parliament in 1897. A member of Giovanni Giolitti's cabinet between 1911 and 1914, Pietro Lanza was named minister of war by Prime Minister Luigi Facta in 1922. Two years later, he was appointed minister of the colonies, a position he held until 1926. Lanza was named senator in 1929.

On Adolfo Omodeo, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 7.

5. On January 7, 1913, Mussolini, who had just become editor of Avanti! published an article in the socialist paper under the headline "Assassinio di stato/z (Assassination by the state) in which he described the bloody events of Roccagorga and elsewhere as the ^slaughtering of proletarians." It was the beginning of a persistent and fierce antigovernment campaign carried out through the pages of Avanti! The authorities reacted by indicting Mussolini and five others affiliated with the paper (Eugenio Guarino, Giuseppe Scalarini, Francesco Ciccotti, Silvano Fasulo, and Aurelio Galassi). At the trial, which took place in Milan between March 26 and April I, 1914, the witnesses for the defense included a number of individuals who had survived the violent onslaughts by the government forces. The testimony of the survivors was reported in detail in the pages of Avanti! and subsequently collected in a booklet, L'eccidio di Roccagorga (Milan: Avanti! 1914), with which Gramsci was certainly familiar.

Ten years later, Gramsci published a scathing attack on Mussolini, who by then had "seized power and [was] holding on to it by means of the most violent and arbitrary repression." In his article "Capo” (Leader), which appeared on the front page of the newly relaunched (third series) Ordine nuovo I, no. 1 (March 1924), Gramsci recalled how Mussolini had taken advantage of the events of Roccagorga； it was, Gramsci maintained, a foreshadowing of the hollowness of his vaunted leadership qualities:

In Italy we have the fascist régime, we have Benito Mussolini as fascism.^ leader, we have an official ideology in which the "leader" is deified, declared to be infallible, prophesied as the organizer and inspirer of a reborn Holy Roman Empire. We see printed in the newspapers, every day, scores and hundreds of telegrams of homage from the vast local tribes to the "leader." We see the photographs: the hardened mask of a face which we have already seen at socialist meetings. We know that face: we know that rolling of the eyes in their sockets, eyes which in the past sought with their ferocious movements to bring shudders to the bourgeoisie, and today seek to do the same to the proletariat. We know that fist always clenched in a threat. We know the whole mechanism, the whole paraphernalia, and we understand that it-may impress and tug at the heartstrings of bourgeois school-children. It is really impressive, even when seen close to, and has an awesome effect. But "leader”?

We saw the Red Week of June 1914. More than three million workers were on the streets, called out by Benito Mussolini, who for about a year since the Roccagorga massacre had been preparing them for the great day, with all the oratorical and journalistic means at the disposal of the then 〃leadet〃 of the Socialist Party, of Benito Mussolini一from Scalarini's lampoon to his great trial at the Milan Assizes. Three million workers were on the streets: but the /zleader/7 Benito Mussolini, was missing. He was missing as a "leader/' not as an individual； for people say that as an individual he was courageous, and defied the cordons and the muskets of the carabinieri in Milan. He was missing as a "leader/' because he was not one, Because, by his own admission, within the leadership of the Socialist Party he could not even manage to get the better of the wretched intrigues of Arturo Vella or Angelica Balabanoff. (Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Political Writings: 1921-1926, ed. and trans. Quintin Hoare [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990], p. 211)

4. Gramsci obtained the information on Count Ottokar Czernin's memoirs from an obituary published by the Corriere della sera on April 6, 1932/ two days after Czetnin's death. Ottokar Czemin's memoirs, Im Weltkriege (Berlin: Ullstein, 1919), have been translated into English: In the World War (New York: Cassell, 1919).

Count Ottokar Czernin (1872-1932), born in Bohemia, was appointed foreign minister of Austria-Hungary by the emperor Karl I in December 1916. Czernin had no choice but to resign in April 1918 when the French prime minister, Georges Clemenceau, revealed that in an effort to extricate Austria from the war, Czernin had participated in secret negotiations with the Entente in 1917. The negotiations had been brokered by Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma (brother of the empress Zita), and they broke down because of Italy's firm demands for the ceding of territory, including Trieste (as stipulated in the Pact of London), that Austria deemed excessive and unacceptable.

1. Mariano D'Ayala (1808-77)； born in Messina, attended military school in Naples and served as an officer in the army of the Bourbon kingdom before he exiled himself from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and became an active participant in the movement for the liberation and unification of the country.

Luigi Villari (1876-1959), on whose lack of seriousness Gramsci makes a caustic comment in Notebook 5, §106, inundated British newspapers and periodicals with articles extolling Fascism. He also managed to get his books published in English by highly respected presses—for example, The Awakening of Italy: The Fascist Regeneration (London: Methuen, 1924), The Fascist Experiment (London: Faber and Gwyer, 1926), and Bolshevism, Fascism, and Capitalism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1932). He was also the author of the article "Fascism" in the 1926 supplement of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Gaetano Salvemini described Villari as "the most active propaganda agent of Fascism in the English-speaking world” (Under the Axe of Fascism [New York: Viking, 1937], p. 7).

On Camillo Pellizzi, see Notebook i, §24/ n. 20.

§124. The economic-corporative phase in Italian history. The Lepanto enterprise
i. Gramsci extracted the information on Alfonso Salimei's book Gli italiani a Lepanto (Rome: Velletri, Zampetti e Figlio, 1931) and on the battle of Lepanto from an item entitled "Gli italiani a Lepanto” (The Italians at Lepanto) in the ''Biblioteca di cultura” (Cultural library) section of Il marzocco 36, no. 49 (December 6, 1931).

2. A. Dragonetti De Torres's book on the diplomatic correspondence between Pius V's nuncio and Philip II of Spain concerning the Lepanto League was reviewed in the "Biblioteca di culturasection of II marzocco 36, no. 26 (June 28, 1931)； this is the likely source of Gramsci's bibliographical annotation.

§127. History of the subaltern classes. La bohème. Charles Baudelaire

1. In February 1848/ Baudelaire launched a periodical, Le salut public, with the collaboration of, among others, Champfleury (pseudonym of Jules Husson). The periodical ceased publication after only one issue.

2. The relatively long quotation and the precise indication of where it is located in the unpaginated introduction leave little room for doubt that Gramsci had a copy of or direct access to this edition (which is not dated but was in fact published in 1930) of Baudelaire's Les fleurs du mal and other poems, with a previously unpublished introductory essay by Henri Régnier. It is not, however, preserved among his books, nor is there any mention of it in his letters.

§128. Economic science

i. Charles Gide and Charles Rist make the following observations on Ricardo's methods and Marx's in their Histoire des doctrines économiques depuis les physiocrates jusqu'à nos jours, 5th ed. (Paris: Recueil Sirey； 1929L a copy of which Gramsci had at Turi:

[Ricardo's] principal work is devoid of a plan, its chapters being mere fragments placed in juxtaposition. His use of the hypothetical method and the constant appeal to imaginary conditions make its reading a task of great difficulty. This abstract method has long held domain over the Mathematical economists. . . . But obscurity of style has not clouded his fame. Indeed, it has stood him in good stead, as it did Marx at a later date....

We have already had occasion to remark that Ricardo also owes a good deal more to the observation of facts than is generally believed, and his practice of postulating imaginary conditions is of course notorious. The impertinent Marxian who still wishes to defend some of the more untenable theories of Marx, such as his doctrine of labour-value, generally finds himself forced to admit that Marx had supposed (the use of suppositions is an unfailing mark of Ricardian influence) the existence of society wherein labour would be always uniform in quality. (C. Gide and C. Rist, A History of Economic Doctrines from the Time of the Physiocrats to the Present Day, trans. R. Richards, 2d ed. [Boston: Heath, 1948], pp. 138-89, 466)

§129. Catholic Action
1. "The Center" refers to the Zentrumspartei, the Catholic party founded in Germany in 1870.

2. In 1886, when the Center Party rejected the German chancellor's demand for a seven-year military budget, Bismarck made a direct appeal to the Vatican seeking cooperation and support in exchange for a thaw in the Kulturkampf. Despite strong pressure from the Vatican, the Center Party, asserting its political autonomy, still refused to approve the military budget. Bismarck dissolved parliament and called new elections.

6. The maggi (singular maggio,n as in the month of May) are a form of popular dramatic poetry (with heroic motifs) sung to a simple melody by large groups. Customarily performed outdoors, the maggi are associated with celebrations of the arrival of spring.

7. The cantastorie, literally, singers of tales, were street performers who sang or narrated stories of chivalric and heroic deeds.

Piero Rébora, born in Milan in 1889, completed his postgraduate studies in Liverpool and later was professor and head of the Department of English at the University of Manchester. Late in his career, he was appointed professor of English at the University of Milan.

§137. Popular literature
i. Gramsci learned of Ernesto Brunetto's article on serial novels and their authors from the "Rassegna della stampa” (Review of the press) section of L'Italia letteraria 4, no. 11 (March 工3, 1932).

§139. Risorgimento. Garibaldi and the phrase "cubic meter of dung"

§140. Past and present. Malta
1. Nerik Mizzi (1885-1950), son of Fortunato, the founder of the Nationalist Movement in Malta, was himself a founding member and coleader of the Nationalist Party that was formed in 1924. At the time Gramsci wrote this note, Mizzi was minister of education under the system of limited self-government that Britain conceded to its island colony. Mizzi, a promoter of Italian culture in his native country, had very close and extensive ties with Italy throughout his political career. In 1940 the British authorities arrested him and deported him to Uganda together with several other Italian sympathizers who were deemed to be a security risk in wartime. There is no evidence that Nerik Mizzi was among the founders of the Italian Nationalist Party, formed in December 1910； at the time, Mizzi was a twenty-five-year-old law student at the University of Urbino.

This note may have been prompted by something Gramsci read in the Rassegna settimanale della stampa estera or in the Manchester Guardian Weekly, both of which he was receiving at Turi.

i. Gramsci is referring to the pagination of his manuscript； see §130 in this notebook.

2. On the Perrone brothers, see Notebook 1, §116, n. 10.

3. Gramsci had a copy of Richard Lewinsohn, Histoire de Pinflation: Le déplacement de la richesse en Europe (1914-192^)^ trans. H. Simondet (Paris: Payot, 1926). He refers to it as an "interesting book" in the letter he wrote Piero Sraffa from Ustica on January 2, 1927, and again in his letter of May 23, 1927 (from the prison in Milan), to Tatiana Schucht. Gramsci also took note of another work by Lewinsohn, Lfargent dans la politique (Paris,

1931) , in a short bibliographical list he jotted down on the back endpaper of the manuscript of Notebook 6 (see the Description of the Manuscript).

§144. Encyclopedic notions. Bibliography
1, Gramsci extracted the bibliographical information on Giulio Rezas-co's dictionary of Italian administrative and historical language (published by Le Monnier) from an article by Federico Chabod, "Giovanni Boterò/7 in Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 5, no. 1 (January-February

1932) : 29-57； see, in particular, p. 41 n. 5.

Apropos of Rezasco's dictionary, Gramsci wrote in his letter of September 5, 1932, to Tatiana Schucht:

I would like to know whether you intend to send [Giulia] any books, because I could suggest the titles of some of them. . . . For example, she ought in my opinion to have at her disposal a whole series of specialized terms. A dictionary that she should definitely have is Rezasco^, which is entitled something like Dizionario (or Vocabolario} della lingua italiana, indispensable for the reading of Italian historical-political literature because of its juridical, political, administrative, military, etc., terms. But this dictionary is out of print and can be found only in secondhand bookstores and is probably quite expensive. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:205)

He repeated many of these comments about six weeks later in another letter (October 17, 1932) to Tatiana Schucht.

2. See Luigi Einaudi "Del modo di scrivere la storia del dogma economico(On how to write the history of economic theory), La riforma sociale 43, no. 2 (March-April, 1932): 207-19； the comments on Rezasco are on p. 208.

On Luigi Einaudi, see Notebook 1, §11, n. 1.

§146. Encyclopedic notions. University
i. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the obsolete meanings of "university" is body or class of persons regarded collectively. "The ^università israelitiche” (literally』the Israelite universities) in fact refers to Jewish communities or the Jewish population； the now archaic term was used in various legal decrees pertaining to the civil, political, and economic rights of Jews living in Italy. The ^università agrarie” were forms of association and cooperation in rural communities that enabled the communal use of land.

§148. Encyclopedic notions
1. Roberto Michels's introductory book on the history of economic and political theory was reviewed by Luigi Einaudi in an article entitled "Del modo di scrivere la storia del dogma economico” (On how to write the history of economic theory), in La riforma sociale 43, no. 2 (Mar ch-Apr il, 1932): 207-19«

On Roberto Michels, see Notebook 2, §45, n. 2.

2. In his article "Del modo di scrivere/7 Einaudi alludes to the Diction-naire de ^economie politique (Paris: Guillaumin, 1873) but does not provide the bibliographical details, which Gramsci derived from some other source and inserted here at a later time.

Einaudi also mentions a dictionary by Palgrave, again without providing any details. He must have been alluding to the three-volume Palgravefs Dictionary of Political Economy, ed. Henry Higgs (London: Macmillan, 1923-26).

3. See Luigi Cossa, Introduzione allo studio dell'economia politica, 3d ed. (Milan: Hoepli, 1892), which has been translated into English as An Introduction to the Study of Political Economy, trans. Louis Dyer (New York: Macmillan, 1893)； and Giuseppe Ricca-Salerno's history of the theory of finance in Italy, Storia delle dottrine finanziarie in Italia col raffronto delle dottrine forestiere e delle istituzioni e condizioni di fatto, 2d ed. (Palermo: Reber, 1896). Einaudi mentions both these works in passing in "Del modo di scrivere/7 without providing any details一hence, also, the inaccurate title given for Cossa's book.

§149. Cultural topics
i. The information reproduced here in square brackets was inserted by Gramsci some time after he first composed this note. The rest of the information he probably derived from two sources: Giuseppe Bottai's introduction to the /zNuova collana di economisti” (New book series of economists), published by UTET of Turin, that appeared in Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 4, no. 3-4 (May-August 1931): 238-40； and Luigi Einaudi's article "Pet una nuova collana di economisti” (For a new book series of economists), in La riforma sociale 38, no. 7-8 (July-August, 1931): 394-99.

Pietro Custodii book series Scrittori Classici Italiani di Economia Politica (Italian classics of political economy) was published in Milan between 1803 and 1816.

Francesco Ferrara (1810-1900) and Gerolamo Boccardo (1829-1904) were, respectively, the first and second of four editors-in-chief of the book series Biblioteca delPEconomista (The economist's library) that was published in Turin over a span of many years (1859-1922).

The Biblioteca di Storia Economica (Collection of economic history), launched and directed by Vilfredo Pareto and Ettore Ciccotti, was published in Milan between 1903 and 1915. On Vilfredo Pareto, see Notebook 4, §18, n. 6； and on Ettore Ciccotti, see Notebook 3, §15, n. 1.

On Giuseppe Bottai, see Notebook 5, §157, n. i.

Attilio Brunialti (1849-1920), who launched the book series Biblioteca di Scienze Politiche e Amministrative (Library of political and administrative science), published by UTET of Turin, also founded the Giornale delle colonie and was among the first to write systematically on Italian colonialism. His books on the subject included Ultalia e la questione coloniale (Milan: Brigola, 1885) and Le colonie degli Italiani (Turin: UTET, 1897).

§150. Encyclopedic notions. Demiurge
i. On Filippo Burzio and his conception of the demiurge, see Notebook I, §2& n. 3.

§151. Cultural topics. Unnatural, natural, etc.
1. Gramsci may have been thinking of one of Blaise Pascal's pensées that is quoted (in a slightly modified form) on p. 469 of Gustave Lanson's Histoire de la littérature frangaise, 19th ed. (Paris: Hachette, n.d.): "Quelle est done cette nature sujette à étre effacée? La coutume est une seconde nature qui détruit la première. Pourquoi la coutume n^est-elle naturelle? Jzai bien peur que cette nature ne soit elle-mème quzune première coutume, comme la coutume est une seconde nature77 (What, then, is this nature that can be effaced? Habit is a second nature that destroys the first. Why is habit not natural? I truly fear that this nature is itself nothing other than a first habit, just as habit is a second nature.)

5. This is an allusion to the farcical character Sor Panerà； see Notebook 6, §6oz n. 2.

§155. Past and present. Fables. Ideas on religion
i. Gramsci is alluding to a Crocean position that is expounded most clearly in Storia d'Europa nel secolo decimonono (Bari: Laterza, 1932). See Notebook 7, §1/ n. 6.

§156. Cultural topics. Unnatural, natural, etc.
1. See §151 and §153 in this Notebook.

2. Immanuel Kant wrote: "There is, therefore, only a single categorical imperative and it is this: act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.... Since the universality of law in accordance with which effects take place constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense (as regards its form)—that is, the existence of things insofar as it is determined in accordance with universal laws—the universal imperative of duty can also go as follows: act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of natureff (Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, ed. and trans. Mary Gregor [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press； 1998], p. 31).

3. Gramsci is referring to the pagination of his manuscript； see §159 in this notebook.

§157. Cultural topics
i. The quotation is taken from the report on the previous day's parliamentary session, published under the headline "Gazzera parla sulla difesa del paese/z (Gazzera speaks on national defense), in the Corriere della sera of April 23, 1932.

Pietro Gazzera (1879-1953) was minister of war from 1929 until 1933/ when Mussolini brought the ministry under his direct control and Gazzera was appointed to the senate.

§159. Cultural topics. Natural, unnatural, etc.

Guido Manacorda, 2 vols. (Milan: Mondadori, 1932).

On Giovanni Papini, see Notebook i, §8, n. 1.

§161. The question of the intellectuals. Sicily and Sardinia
1. Giovanni Lorenzoni was one of the experts engaged by a parliamentary commission that was set up to examine the condition of agrarian workers in southern Italy and Sicily. In 1907 Lorenzoni produced an exhaustive study of the socioeconomic situation in Sicily that was later published as volume 6 of the commission's report: Relazione della Commissione d'inchiesta Parlamentare per accertare le condizioni dei lavoratori della terra nelle provinole meridionali e in Sicilia (Rome: Bertero, 1909).

2. Giovanni Molè conducted an official study on landownership in Sicily for a permanent committee on internal migration in the ministry of public works； see Giovanni Molè, Studio-inchiesta sui latifondi siciliani (Rome: Tipografìa del Senato, 1929).

The source of the data recorded by Gramsci in this note is an article by Emanuele De Cillis, "L'agricoltura nella Sicilia e nella Sardegna” (Agriculture in Sicily and Sardinia), Nuova antologia 67, no. 1441 (April i, 1932): 375-87.

§162. Machiavelli
i. See Gino Arias, "Il pensiero economico di Niccolò Machiavelli” (Machiavelli^ economie thought), in Annali di Economia, voi. 4 (Milan: Università Bocconi, 1928)/ pp. 1-31.

On this article, Gramsci's correspondence about it, and Gino Arias, see Notebook 6, §66, n. 1.

2. Arias's "Il pensiero economico di Niccolò Machiavelli" refers, in a footnote (p. 2 n. 2), to an essay on Machiavelli's political thought by Vincenzo Tangorra, 〃I1 pensiero economico di Niccolò Machiavelli,,z that appeared in Saggi critici di economia politica (Turin: Bocca, 1900).

3. See Federico Chabod's "Giovanni Boterò," published in three parts in Nuovi studi di diritto, economia e politica 4, no. 5 (September-October 1931)： 251-84； 4/ no. 6 (November-December, 1931): 341-69； 5/ no. i (January-February, 1932): 29-57.

On Giovanni Boterò, see Notebook 3, §141, n. 2.

Federico Chabod (1901-60), born in Aosta, was a distinguished historian who taught at the universities of Perugia, Milan, and Rome and in 1948 assumed the editorship of the Rivista storica italiana. In addition to his many studies on Renaissance political thought, Chabod also wrote on late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century Italian and European politics. During World War II, he was a leader of the resistance in the Vai d‘Aosta region.

4. See the following works by Mario De Bernardi, Giovanni Bolero economista (Turin: Istituto Giuridico della Reale Università di Torino, 1931)；

Appunti bibliografici intorno a Giovanni Boterò” (Bibliographical notes concerning Giovanni Boterò), in volume 65 (1930) of the Atti della Reale Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Science of Turin)； and 〃I1 concetto di 'ragion di Stato' in Giovanni Boterò e la filosofia della politica” (The concept of raison d'état in Giovanni Boterò and political philosophy), in volume 64 (1929) of the Atti della Reale Accademia delle Scienze di Torino. De Bernardi also edited the republication of the 1588 edition of Giovanni Botero's Delle cause della grandezza delle città (Turin: Istituto Giuridico della Reale Università di Torino, 1930). All these publications were reviewed in Luigi Einaudi怎 review essay 〃Di un quesito attorno alla nascita della scienza economica” (On a question regarding the birth of economic science), in La riforma sociale 43, no. 2 (March-April 1932): 219-25.

7. See Tatiana Schucht's letter of April 27/ 1932, to Gramsci, quoted in Notebook 6, §66, n. 1, in which she conveys Sraffa^s response to a query from Gramsci.

In Capital, Marx makes several references to William Petty, including the following: 〃Let me point out once and for all that by classical political economy I mean all the economists who, since the time of W. Petty, have investigated the real internal framework [Zusammenhang] of bourgeois relations of production, as opposed to the vulgar economists who only-flounder around within the apparent framework of those relations” (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes [London: Penguin, 1976], p. 174 n.

34). See also K. Marx, Theories of Surplus Value, ed. S. Ryazanskaya, trans. Emile Burns (London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1963), 1:179-82.

Sir William Petty (1623-87), physician, statistician, economist, and a founding member of the Royal Society, was the author of among other things, A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions (1662) and Quantulum-cunque Concerning Money (1682).

8. Gramsci is referring to Karl Marx, Theorien über den Mehrwert, ed. Karl Kautsky, 3 vols. (Stuttgart: J.H. W. Dietz, 1910). Before his arrest, Gramsci had a copy of this work in French translation: Histoire de doctrines économiques, trans. J. Molitor, 8 vols. (Paris: Costes, 1924-25). It was among the works that Gramsci asked Tatiana Schucht to send him in his letter of March 25/ 1929. The eight slim volumes are preserved among Gramsci's books’ but they are not stamped with the prison seal, which means that they were never delivered to him一perhaps because of a prohibition by the prison warden. The work has been translated into English； see K. Marx, Theories of Surplus Value, ed. S. Ryazanskaya and R. Dixon, trans. Renate Simpson, 3 vols. (London: Lawrence and Wishart? 1969-72).

§164. Encyclopedic notions. Bibliography
i. The collection of technical terms by Carlo Porro, Terminologia geografica: Raccolta di vocaboli di geografìa e scienze affini per uso degli studi di geografia generale e militare, was first published by UTET of Turin in 1902 and reprinted the following year.

Giovanni Davinci's legal encyclopedia "for use by businessmen and educated persons/7 Uawocato di tutti: Piccola enciclopedia legale, was first published by UTET of Turin in 1927. A revised edition with a new supplement was published in 1931.

Since both these reference works were published by UTET, it is very likely that Gramsci learned about them from the publisher's catalog or from other publicity material enclosed with the books that were mailed to him.

§165. Oriani

1. On Alfredo Oriani, see Notebook 4, §68, n. 2.

2. See Alfredo Oriani, La lotta politica in Italia: Origini della lotta attuale, 476-1887 (Rome: L. Roux, 1892).

3. In the 1920s and 1930s, the nationalists and the fascists exalted the memory of Oriani and made of him one of their illustrious spiritual precursors. Mussolini appointed himself editor of Oriani^ Opera omnia (Bologna: Cappelli, 1923-33), and Giovanni Gentile wrote an introduction to a new edition of La lotta politica (Bologna: Cappelli, 1929), while the literary periodicals and scholarly journals published innumerable articles about him.

§166. Grazia dei
1. On Achille Loria, see Notebook 1, §25, n. 1.

2. Gramsci is alluding to the questions raised by Antonio Graziadei； questions that he also discusses in Notebook 1, §63, and Notebook 7, §23 and §42. See also the related Notes to the Text.

On Antonio Graziadei, see Notebook i, §42, n. 3.

Johann Karl Rodbertus (1805-75), a Prussian economist, held that the maintenance of social and economic stability required the government to play a role in regulating the economy. He argued, for example, that increases in productivity do not necessarily bring with them higher wages and an improvement in the general standard of living but tend rather to benefit disproportionately the minority of property owners. The imbalance could only be prevented or corrected by government intervention. In Capital, Marx cites Rodbertus^ Sociale Briefe an von Kirchmann: Dritter Brief (Berlin, 1851) and comments that "in spite of its erroneous theory of rent, it sees through the nature of capitalist production." Marx provides a detailed critique of Rodbertus^ theories in part 2, chapters 8 and 9, of the Theories of Surplus Value (on which, see Notebook 8Z §162, n. 8). In the third German edition of Capital, Engels added a note in which he quotes a letter by Rodbertus that epitomizes both his view on wages and his disdain for Marx:

"Capital must be rescued not only from labor, but from itself, and that will be best effected by treating the acts of the industrial capitalist as economic and political functions that have been delegated to him with his capital and by treating his profit as a form of salary, because we still know no other social organization. But salaries may be regulated and may also be reduced if they take too much from wages. The irruption of Marx into society, as I may call his book, must be warded off. ... Altogether, Marx's book is not so much an investigation into capital as a polemic against the present form of capital, a form which he confuses with the concept of capital itself” (Briefe, eta, von Dr. Robertus-Jaget-zow, edited by Dr. Rudolf Meyer, Berlin, 1881, Vol. i, p. in, 48th letter from Rodbertus). The bold onslaught mounted by Rodbertus in his ^social letters" finally dwindled down to ideological commonplaces of this . kind. (Karl Marx, Capital, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (London: Penguin, 1976), p. 66911)

4. Charles Gide and Charles Rist, Histoire des doctrines économiques depuis les physiocrates jusqu'à nos jours, 5th ed. (Paris: Recueil Sirey, 1929), p. 504. Although this volume is not preserved among Gramsci怎 books, this direct quotation and other allusions to it in the notebooks indicate that he had a copy of it that has been lost or had access to it during his time at Turi. In the English edition of this work, A History of Economic Doctrines from the Time of the Physiocrats to the Present Day, trans. R, Richards, 2d ed. (Boston: Heath, 1948), the passage quoted by Gramsci is translated as follows: "The difference between |Rodbertuszs] attitude and Marx's is also interesting. Marx was thoroughly well versed in political economy, and had made a special study of the English socialists. His one object was to set up a new theory of exchange, with labour as the source of all value. Rodbertus； who drew his inspiration from the Saint-Simonians, focused attention upon production, and treated labour as the real source of every product—a simpler, a truer, but a still incomplete proposition. Rodbertus never definitely commits himself to saying that labour by itself creates value, butz on the other hand； he never denies it〃(p. 423).

5. “In a letter written to R. Meyer on January 7, 1872/ [Rodbertus] affirms the demonstration he had already given, 'that goods do not and cannot exchange merely in proportion to the quantity of labour which has been absorbed by them simply because of the existence of capital7； and he adds the significant words: 'a demonstration that might in case of need be employed against Marx'〃(Gide and Rist, A History of Economic Doctrines, p. 423 n. 2).

§167. De Man's book

1. The comments in this note were prompted by Guido De Ruggiero's review of Henri De Man's Der Kampf um die Arbeitsfreude (Jena: Died-erichs, 1927], which had been recently published in Italian translation as La gioia del lavoro (Bari: Laterza, 1930). In his review一in La critica 29, no. 3 (May 20, 1931): 213-16一De Ruggiero referred to an earlier book of De Man's that is the target of repeated criticism in the notebooks, namely. Zur Psychologie des Sozialismus (Jena: Diederichs, 1926)； that was translated into Italian as II superamento del marxismo (Bari: Laterza, 1929). De Ruggiero wrote； on the opening page of his review: Z/Not long after the book on II superamento del marxismo, we now have the Italian translation of this new work by De Man that specifically illustrates and reinforces the earlier one. Whereas the earlier book followed a primarily theoretical path, because it refuted the theories of historical materialism and brought into relief the psychological and ethical values of the proletarian movement, the present book . . ,tf (p. 213).

On Henri De Man and the different translations of the books mentioned here (of which Gramsci had copies at Turi), see Notebook i, §6i, n. 13.

2. Gramsci is alluding to a passage in Marx's preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy^ see Notebook 4, §15, n. 7,

3. That is, the misguided pursuit of an argument that arrives at a conclusion that is irrelevant because it has no bearing on the matter being addressed.

§168. Antonio Labriola and Hegelianism
I. Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841), who studied with Johann Gotl-lieb Fichte at Jena, succeeded Kant as professor of philosophy at Königsberg in 1808. He was primarily interested in philosophical psychology, or the philosophy of mind, and this led him to develop a theory of education that in the late nineteenth century gained wide currency among pedago-gists and also influenced certain political philosophers who found in Herbartl work an especially useful approach to ethics and social psychology. Antonio Labriola^ attraction to Herbart^s ideas is clearly manifested in his theoretical writings as well as his correspondence.

On Antonio Labriola, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 51.

§169. Unity of theory and practice
1. See, in particular, Notebook 4, §38, and Notebook 7, §33.

2. Gramsci had been propounding some of these ideas since the beginning of his political career； see, for example, his article "Socialismo e cultura" (Socialism and culture), in II grido del popolo, January 29, 1916, quoted in Notebook 6, §87, n. 2.

§170. Scientific ideologies
1. Arthur Stanley Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World (New York: Macmillan, 1929), pp. 1-2. Gramsci had a copy of the French translation of Eddington's book, La nature du monde physique (Paris: Payot, 1929), from which he translated this sentence into Italian. I quote the original in the text.

2. See Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, Escursione in terre nuove (Milan: Ceschina, 1931), of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi. Commenting on Eddington's assertion, Borgese writes: /zBut can we be sure that, in the final analysis, such a speck endures and exists? Is it not possible that further analysis, a more penetrating method of investigation, would disperse even this minuscule positive element into the void? 'Matter abandons the universe' 〃 (p. 40).

On Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, see Notebook 1, §93, n. 2.

§172. Bibliographies
i. That is, when major writings on Marx and Marxism by Antonio Labriola and Benedetto Croce were published.

On Antonio Labriola, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 51.

2. 〃Le premesse filosofiche del socialismo” (The philosophical premises of socialism) is the title of a paper by Alessandro Chiappelli, published in the Atti della Reale Accademia di Scienze Morali e Politiche di Napoli (Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of Naples) in 1896.

On Alessandro Chiappelliz see Notebook 5/ §125/ n. 2.

§173. On the Popular Manual

1. See, for example, the opening paragraph of Benedetto Croce's little article 〃I1 non-filosofo/, (The nonphilosopher): abhor the bad philosopher, presumptuous and amateurish: presumptuous in his easy way of dealing with difficult things, amateurish when it comes to sacred things. But I really love the nonphilosopher, unperturbed, indifferent to philosophical disputes, distinctions, and dialectics； he possesses truth in a few simple principles, in lucid statements, the dependable guides of his judgments and actions一the man of good sense and wisdom" (B.

2. The quotation is from Henri Gouhier's review of Léon Brunschvicg's De la connaissance de soi (Paris: Alcan, 1931) in Les nouvelles littéraires io, no. 470 (October 17, 1931). The titles of the other books by the French idealist philosopher Léon Brunschvicg (1869-1944) are also culled from Gouhier's review.

2. This is the third of Giuseppe Giustfs Epigrammi (1849)； Gramsci is probably quoting from memory.

On Giuseppe Giusti, see Notebook 5, §42, n. 1.

3. Gentile uses the phrase "uomo sano/ which can mean "healthy man" or "sane man,/； it has been translated here as "sound manz, in order to retain the ambiguity to which Gramsci points.

This is the second of three unsigned articles in La civiltà cattolica一probably by the same author (the second article contains a reference to the first)—that together constitute an extensive critique of Giovanni Gentile's philosophy. The other two articles are "Coltura e religione in un discorso di G. Gentile a Bologna” (Culture and religion in a speech by Gentile in Bologna), La civiltà cattolica 8i, no. 2 (May 3, 1930): 223-37； and "L'ignoto e la religione naturale secondo il Senatore Gentile” (The unknown and naturai religion according to Senator Gentile), La civiltà cattolica 81, no. 4 (December 6, 1930): 422-33.

§179. The ethical or cultural state
1. In Elements of the Philosophy of Right (§§257, 258), Hegel wrote:

The state is the actuality of the ethical Idea—the ethical spirit as substantial will, manifest and clear to itself, which thinks and knows itself and implements what it knows in so far as it knows it. It has its immediate existence [Existenz] in custom and its mediate existence in the self-consciousness of the individual [des Einzelnen], in the individual's knowledge and activity just as self-consciousness, by virtue of its disposition, has its substantial freedom in the state as its essence, its end, and the product of its activity....

The state is the actuality of the substantial will, an actuality which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness when it has been raised to its universality； as such, it is the rational in and for itself. This substantial unity is an absolute and unmoved end in itself, and in it, freedom enters into its highest right, just as this ultimate end possesses the highest right in relation to individuals [die Einzelnen], whose highest duty is to be members of the state.

If the state is confused with civil society and its determination is equated with the security and protection of property and personal freedom, the interest of individuals [der Einzelnen] as such becomes the ultimate end for which they are united； it also follows from this that membership of the state is an optional matter. But the relationship of the state to the individual [Individuum] is of quite a different kind. Since the state is objective spirit, it is only through being a member of the state that the individual [Individuum] himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life. Union as such is itself the true content and end, and the destiny [Bestimmung] of individuals [Individuen] is to lead a universal life； their further particular satisfaction, activity, and mode of conduct have this substantial and universally valid basis as their point of departure and result. (G.W. F. Hegel, Elements of the Philosophy of Right, ed. Allen W. Wood, trans. H.B. Nisbet [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991], pp. 275-76)

§181. Hegelianism in France
1. All this information and the quotation are extracted from Guido De Ruggiero's review of the proceedings of the Hegel Congress of 1930, in La critica 39, no. 6 (November 20, 1931): 445-52.

Lucien Herr (1864-1926), philosopher and socialist activist, was appointed head librarian of the École Normale Supérieure in 1888. Together with Jean Jaurès, he helped found the journal Lhumanité.

2. The citation and quotation from Andler's biography of Lucien Herr are derived from the "Revue des revues" section of Les nouvelles littérai-res io, no. 472 (October 31, 1931).

§183. Dialectics
I. This title (with the bibliographical details) is listed in the "Libri per-venuti,/ (Books received) section of La civiltà cattolica 81, no. 4 (November 13, 1930): 384.

§184. Formal logic
1. See Notebook 7, §3, n. 2.

2. Gramsci discusses Bertrand Russell in Notebook 4/ §41, and Notebook 7, §25.

3. See nMetodologia o agnosticismo(Methodology or agnosticism?), La civiltà cattolica 81, no. 4 (November 13/ 1930): 331-43. '

§187. Intellectuals
i. Gramsci is alluding to Hegelzs scathing critique of the conservative and authoritarian political philosopher Karl Ludwig von Haller (17681854), specifically Haller's six-volume treatise on the ,,restoration/, of political science, Restauration der Staats-Wissenschaft (Winterthur: Steiner, 1816-20), in §258 of the Elements of the Philosophy of Right, where Hegel describes Haller as "totally devoid of thoughtSee G.W.F. Hegel, Elements of the Philosophy of Right, ed. Allen W. Wood, trans. H.B. Nisbet (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991), pp. 278-81.

§188. The intellectuals. The organization of cultural life
1. The Società Italiana per il Progresso della Scienza (Italian society for the advancement of science), also known by its acronym SIPS, has a complicated genealogy, stretching back to pre-Risorgimento Italy. In 1839 a group of learned men, inspired by associations of scientists that had been formally established in Britain and Germany, organized a scientific congress in Pisa with participants from every part of the peninsula. Similar congresses were held in subsequent years (though not annually). Following the unification of the country, an effort was made, at a congress held in Palermo in 1875, to formalize the existence of a national scientific society； a statute was drafted and approved, but it was followed by a lull in activity. Finally, in 1906, at a congress in Milan, a new statute was drawn up and approved that formally established SIPS.

The British Association for the Advancement of Science (now known as the BA) was founded in 1831.

2. See Notebook 4, §50.

§190. The concept of the state
i. In Technique du coup d'etat (Paris: Granet, 1931), Curzio Malaparte described the fascists as "worshipers of the state, the advocates of an absolute state,n and he quotes Mussolini as saying, "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.〃 He then goes on to compare this with Leninzs "Where there is liberty, there is no state77 (p. 9). It is difficult to determine how and where Gramsci learned of the contents of this particular work of Malapartezs since it was effectively banned by the Fascist regime. (Malaparte was expelled from the Fascist Party and had to spend some time in internal exile, first at Lipari and then at Ischia.) Malaparte's Technique du coup d^tat was published in English as Coup drEtat: The Technique of Revolution, trans. Sylvia Saunders (New York: Dutton, 1932).

On Curzio Malaparte, see Notebook 1, §8, n. 1.

2. Gramsci is referring to a passage in Frederick Engels's Anti-Dühring that is also found in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. The relevant part of the text is quoted in Notebook 4, §40, n. 1.

§192. Originality and intellectual order

i. Gramsci's source of this quotation has not been traced. The maxims of Vauvenargues (1715-47) have been translated into English: The Reflections and Maxims of Luc de Clapiers, Marquis of Vauvenargues, trans. F.G. Stevens (London: Milford, 1940).

§193. Relations between city and country

i. The Italian translation of Mihail Manoilescu^ book on protectionism, La teoria del protezionismo (Milan: Treves, 1931)； was reviewed in many of the periodicals Gramsci read at Turi. The quotation, however, is from an article by Gino Arias, 〃La difesa doganale: Problemi economici e politici” (The defense of tariffs: Economie and political problems), Gerarchia il, no. 12 (December 1931): 987-94, in which Manoilescu's book is discussed and quoted extensively； see, in particular, p. 989. A version of Manoilescu's book also appeared in English, The Theory of Protection and International Trade (London: P. S. King and Son, 1931).

Mihail Manoilescu (1891-1950) met Mussolini in 1926 and became an admirer； he would subsequently write a book on the fascist theory of corporativism, Le siècle du corporatisme [Paris: Alcan, 1934). In his native Romania, Manoilescu actively promoted restoration of the monarchy, for which he was temporarily imprisoned. His book on protectionism was first published in France: Theorie du protectionnisme et de Péchange international (Paris: Giard, 1929). Following the return of King Charles II, Manoilescu was appointed economics minister. He later served as foreign minister in the government of the profascist Ion Gigurtu.

§194. Formal logic

i. The French translation (published in 1931) of Tobias Dantzig's Number: The Language of Science. A Critical Survey Written for the Cultured Non -Ma th em atician (New York: Macmillan, 1930) is mentioned in an article by Emilio Radius, "Sua esattezza il Numero" (His Exactness the Number), in the Corriere della sera of February 4, 1932, which is the most likely source of this note.

§195. The proposition that "society does not set itself problems for whose solution the material preconditions do not already ___• _. ”
exist.

i. See Notebook 4, §38, n. 1.

§198. Philosophy of praxis
1. See the chapter "Marxismo e filosofia^ (Marxism and philosophy) in Benedetto Crocei Conversazioni critiche, ist ser. (Bari: Laterza, 1918), pp. 296-306, of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi. Among other things, Croce writes that Marx's "inversion consisted in replacing philosophy with practice and the philosopher with the revolutionary. ... It was not just Hegelian philosophy that Marx turned upside down but philosophy in general, philosophy of any kind； and he replaced philosophizing with practical activity, which for him was in fact nothing other than the revolutionary activity of the proletariat" (p. 299).

"The Glosses on Feuerbach" denotes the Theses on Feuerbach. The specific focus here is on the eleventh thesis: 〃The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways； the point, however, is to change it〃 (K. Marx and E Engels, Collected Works, vol. 5, 1845-1847 [New York: International, 1975], P- 8|.

2. In one of his footnotes in Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica, 4th ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1921), Croce writes: "From this point of view (that is, limiting the statement to the theory of knowledge), we might, like Labriola, speak of historical materialism as a philosophy of praxis, that is, as a particular way of conceiving and resolving, or rather of overcoming, the problem of thought and being" (p. 10911). The version in the English translation of Croce's book is somewhat different； see Historical Materialism and the Economics of Karl Marx (London: Allen and Unwin, 1914), p. 11511. Gramsci had a copy of Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica at Turi.

On Antonio Labriola, see Notebook 1, §44/ n. 51.

§199. Unity of theory and practice
I. In his Summa theologiae (L79.11), Thomas Aquinas wrote: "The speculative intellect by extension becomes practical {De Anima iii, 10). But one power is not changed into another. Therefore the speculative and practical intellects are not distinct powers/7 As Aquinas's citation indicates, the primary source of this maxim is the Latin version of Aristotle's De Anima. Gramsci probably came across this maxim in La civiltà cattolica, possibly in the article "Dopo un decennio: 1922-1932” (After a decade) in 83, no. I： 193-200. In this article, however, the maxim is quoted (p. 198) without any attribution. Gramsci added "by St. Thomas" sometime after he had initially composed this note.

2. Leibniz's aphorism "The more speculative, the more practical" recurs frequently in Croce's writings； see, for example, p. 226 of Materialismo storico ed economia marxistica, 4th ed, (Bari: Laterza, 1921), and p. 19 of Cultura e vita morale, rev. ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1926). Gramsci had a copy of each of these books at Turi； he also had a book entitled Introduzione allo studio delle opere di Benedetto Croce (Introduction to the study of Croce's works) in which the author, Giovanni Castellano, states that Leibniz's aphorism was Croce's "favorite maxim" (p. 235).

3. Giambattista Vico establishes the principle of "verum ipsum factum” (the true and the made are the same) at the very beginning of the first chapter of De antiquissima Italorum sapientia: "For the Latins, verum (the true) and factum (what is made) are interchangeable, or to use the customary language of the Schools, they are convertible. . . . Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the ancient sages of Italy entertained the following beliefs about the true, 'The true is precisely what is made' ( Verum esse ipsum factum). . . . Thus, science is knowledge of the genus or mode by which a thing is made, and by this very knowledge the mind makes the thing, because in knowing it puts together the elements of that thing” (On the Most Ancient Wisdom of the Italians, trans. L.M. Palmer [Ithaca, N.Y,: Cornell University Press, 1988], pp. 45-46). In the Scienza nuova, this principle becomes the basis of Vico's affirmation that history is made by men. In §331, he writes: "But in the night of thick darkness enveloping the earliest antiquity . . . there shines the eternal and never failing light of a truth beyond all question: that the world of civil society has certainly been made by men, and that its principles are therefore to be found within the modifications of our own human mind. Whoever reflects on this cannot but marvel that the philosophers should have bent all their energies to the study of the world of nature, which, since God made it, He alone knows； and that they should have neglected the study of the world of nations, or civil world, which, since man had made it； men could come to know.".And in §349: "For the first indubitable principle posited above [§331] is that this world of nations has certainly been made by men, and its guise must therefore be found within the modifications of our human mind. And history cannot be more certain than when he who creates the things also narrates them〃 {The New Science of Giambattista Vico, trans. Thomas Goddard Bergin and Max Harold Fisch [Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1968], pp. 96, 104).

4. See Benedetto Croce, La filosofia di Giambattista Vico (Bari: Laterza, 1911)/ no copy of which is preserved among Gramsci's books but which Gramsci had almost certainly read. Gramsci, however, did have at Turi a volume of Croce's with extensive discussions of Vico, namely. Saggio sullo Hegel, 3d ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1927)； see especially the chapter "Fonti della gnoseologia vichiana〃 (Sources of Vico's theory of knowledge), in which Croce rebuts criticisms of his book on Vico.

§200. Antonio Labriola
1. On Antonio Labriola, see Notebook I, §44, n. 51.

2. "The Herbartian Professor" is Antonio Labriola, who, before turning to Hegel and Marx, was attracted to the philosophy (and especially the pedagogical theories) of Johann Friedrich Herbart (see Notebook 8, §168, n. i).

3. Benedetto Croce, Conversazioni critiche, 2d sei. (Bari: Laterza, 1918), pp. 60-61» Gramsci had a copy of this work at Turi, In his critical remarks on this quotation, Gramsci appears also to be thinking of the comments by Croce that immediately follow it: nHerein lies the problem. It is not so much a question of rejecting the concept of culture but of defining it accurately in order to find the proper and effective way to disseminate culture. And sometimes this might also require the method of odi profanum vul-gus and of violently driving people back from the threshold of the temple of science, forcing them to stay outside until they make themselves worthy” (p. 60).

4. See Antonio Labriola, Scritti vani editi e inediti di filosofìa e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1906), pp. 432-41. The interview that Gramsci refers to was published under the title "Il ritardo storico della borghesia italiana e le vie dell'espansione coloniale” (The historical backwardness of the Italian bourgeoisie and the avenues of colonial expansion), in the Giornale d'Italia of April 13, 1902 (not 1903, as Gramsci surmises). Labriola favored Italian occupation of Libya, arguing that Italy should not refrain from an enterprise that other European countries were already engaged in and that would contribute to the development of backward nations.

5. On Giovanni Gentile and his educational reform, see Notebook 1, §15, n. I； Notebook 4/ §50, n. 1； and Notebook 4, §53, n. 6.

6. See Notebook 8, §53, and n. 1 there.

On Bertrando Spaventa, see Notebook 4, §56/ n. 5.

7. In the introduction to the Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Marx wrote: 〃A school which legitimates the baseness of today by the baseness of yesterday, a school that declares rebellious every cry of the serf against the knout once that knout is a time-honoured, ancestral, historical one, a school to which history only shows its posterior as the God of Israel did to his servant Moses一the historical school of law—would hence have invented German history had it not been an invention of German history" (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 3, 1843-1844 [New York: International, 1975], p. 177). Gramsci had access to this text in the selected and collected editions of Marx's writings that he had at Turi.

8. This is probably an allusion to the "labor armies0 formed in Russia in 1919-20, an experiment that was rather short-lived. In Notebook §52, however, Gramsci is critical of Trotsky's adoption of a military model for the organization of labor.

§201. The Popular Manual. On art

I. On the question of form and content in art, Bukharin writes: /zThe content ("subject"), almost impossible to isolate from the form, is obviously determined by the social environment, as may be readily seen from the history of the arts〃 (Historical Materialism: A System of Sociology [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1969], p. 194).

§203. History and antihistory
i. On this topic, see also Gramsci's observations on Adriano Tilgherzs book Storia e antistoria in Notebook 1, §28/ and Notebook 3, §135； and on Croce's 〃Antistoria〃 in Notebook 6, §10.

§204. An introduction to the study of philosophy
I. Gramsci inserted this internal cross-reference after he completed this note. He is referring to a page in a notebook he started later and that corresponds to Notebook 10,1, §17, in this edition.

§205. Mechanistic determinism and action-will
i. See D.S. Mirsky, "The Philosophical Discussion in the C.P.S.U. in 1930-31/〃 Labour Monthly 13, no. 10 (October 1931): 649-56. This article was certainly of the greatest interest to Gramsci. It provided him with information about theoretical debates and conflicts in the Soviet Union that interested him directly, especially since they involved a clash between an idealist current and the "mechanicist" school of thought, against which his critique of Bukharin is in large part directed. The censorship system in prison made it nearly impossible for Gramsci to receive communist or socialist publications. The Labor Monthly, which he received thanks to Piero Sraffa's initiative, somehow slipped through——perhaps because the censor could not read English. Gramsci was understandably cautious: he does not write down the title of Mirsky's article (as a result of which it is misidentified in many editions of Gramsci's writings), and he refers to its contents in very vague terms. Still, as one can see from the following passages, Mir・ sky's account of the philosophical battles waged in the Soviet Union and their political implications was very relevant to Gramsci's own philosophical analyses and double-edged critique of materialism and idealism:

[The journal] Under the banner of Marxism became the organ of professional philosophers, headed by A. M. Deborin and who came to be known as the "philosophical leadership/7 ... For some time his [i.e., Deborin^] philosophical supremacy remained unchallenged (except by the mech-anicists) and it was not till the great wave of Bolshevisation in 1930 that it became generally clear that his position was to say the least by no means identical with genuine Marxism. ... The "unity of theory and practice" continued of course to be recognized as a fundamental element of Marxism, but the practical workers had no time as it were to insist on this principle in a theoretical way, while theoreticians like Deborin were content to pay theoretical lip-service to it.

On the other hand the Deborinites did some good work combating the zzmechanicists// that is to say those unphilosophical materialists, recruited for the most part from scientists who had joined the C.P. . . . but who, like all the rank and file of bourgeois scientists, are constitutionally averse to all philosophy. Their slogan was "Science is its own philosophy.... Their inadequate philosophical equipment prevented them from realizing the political implications of their mechanistic theory and its essential identity with the mechanistic and anti-dialectical pseudoMarxism of Bukharin. . . . Deborin and his followers did a great deal to show up the anti-Marxist character of the theories of the Mechanicists [sic] as well as Bukharin. Their real services in this direction obscured for some time the fact that they had themselves deviated in the opposite direction, into something essentially different from Marxism.

If the mechanicists had neglected or rejected dialectic and advocated a Materialism that was neither capable of explaining revolutionary practice nor consonant with the recent advances in physical science, Deborin by unduly emphasizing Dialectic as distinct from Materialism tended to substitute for dialectical Materialism a dialectical scholasticism that was devoid of material content and was thus virtually idealistic. . . . An uncritical attitude towards Hegel (whose dialectic stood on its idealistic head, and had to be placed on materialistic feet before it could be of any use for the cause of Communism) became a characteristic factor of the "philosophical leadership."

Both the mechanicists and the Deborinites represented deviations from genuine Marxism which might be tolerated during the relative lull in class struggle, but which became intolerable in the conditions created by the great Socialist offensive of 1929-30....

The signal for the overhauling of the philosophical, as of other ideological sectors was given . . . by Stalin's speech in December, 1929.... The young philosophers [of the Institute of Red Professors of Philosophy and Natural Science] had attacked Deborin for excessive abstractness of thought and a neglect of coordinating theory with practice. . . . The organizational outcome of the discussion was an overhauling of the editorial board of Under the Banner of Marxism； the new board was composed of men capable of keeping in the general line and of replacing the abstract scholasticism of the Deborinites by the genuine dialectical materialism of Marx, Lenin, and the C.P. (pp. 651-53)

Gramsci also read two other articles by D.S. Mirsky: posto di Dos-tojevskij nella letteratura russa77 (The place of Dostoyevsky in Russian literature), La cultura io, no. 2 (February 1931): 100-115)； and "Bourgeois History and Historical Materialism/〃 Labour Monthly 13/ no. 7 (July 1931)- 453-59« Gramsci alludes to both articles and makes some general admiring comments on Mirsky in his letter of August 3/ 1931, to Tatiana Schucht (and also, indirectly, to Piero Sraffa):

I have taken a quick look at Prince Mirsky's article on the theory of history and historiography and it seems to me that it is a very interesting and valuable essay. Some months back I read Mirsky's essay on Dostoyevsky published in the special issue of Cultura devoted to Dostoyevsky. This essay too was extremely acute, and it is surprising that Mirsky has with so much intelligence and penetration mastered at least a part of the central core of historical materialism. I feel that his scientific position is all the more worthy of notice and study inasmuch as he shows that he is free of certain prejudices and cultural incrustations that had parasitically infiltrated the theoretical studies of the theory of history as a result of the great popularity enjoyed by positivism at the end of the last century and the beginning of the present one. (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:51)

Dimitri Petrovic Svyatopolk-Mirsky (1890-1939), a son of the aristocracy whose father served as Russia's interior minister between 1904 and 1905, fought in the First World War and the Russian civil war (on the antirevolutionary side), moved to England, and taught Russian literature at Kings College University of London from 1922 to 1932. He wrote extensively on literature and on the Russian situation, establishing many friendships with leading European writers and intellectuals of the time. His best-known work is A History of Russian Literature, first published in 1926. Mirsky, who had become a Communist, returned to the Soviet Union in 工932/ was arrested in 1937, and died in the gulag.

§206. Lange's history of materialism
i, Gramsci is referring to the work of the German neo-Kantian philosopher and socialist Friedrich Albert Lange (1828-75), Geschichte des Materialismus und Kritik seiner Bedeutung in der Gegenwart, rev. ed., 3 vols. (Leipzig: Baedeker, 1873-75), which was first published in 1866. Gramsci may have been familiar with the French translation (based on the second edition) of Lange's work: Histoire du matérialisme et critique de son importance à notre époque, trans. B. Pommerol, 2 vols. (Paris: Reinwald, 1877-79).

2. Gramsci is echoing a remark in George V. Plekhanov, Fundamental Problems of Marxism, trans. Eden Paul and Cedar Paul (New York: International, 1929): 〃F. A. Lange, who has done so much to spread among the general public and the scientific world a completely erroneous idea of the essence of materialism and its history, refuses to regard Feuerbach's humanism as a materialist doctrine. Lange's example has been followed by almost all subsequent writers on Feuerbach, whether in Russia or elsewhere(p. 5). Plekhanov's book was first published in Russian in 1908； at Turi, Gramsci had a copy of the French translation. Les questions fondamentales du marxisme (Paris: Editions Sociales Internationales, 1927).

On George V. Plekhanov, see Notebook 3/ §31, n. 4.

3. The Italian translation of Lange's book announced by the Athena publishing house of Milan was never published. As Gramsci points out in a parenthetical addition to this note, a translation did eventually get published: Storia critica del materialismo, 2 vols., trans. Angelo Treves (Milan: Monanni, 1932).

§207. Questions of terminology
1. This is almost a direct quotation of Marx's affirmation in the preface to the Critique of Political Economy that "the anatomy of civil society has to be sought in political economy.n See Karl Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, ed. Maurice Dobb, trans. S. W. Ryazanskaya (New York: International, 1970), p. 20.

2. Here, too, Gramsci is echoing what Marx wrote in the preface to the Critique of Political Economy: Z/Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness" (p. 21). See also Gramsci's reflections on this same point in Notebook 1, §113/ and Notebook io, II, §4i.xii.

§208. The [mutual] translatability of national cultures
i. The relevant passage from The Holy Family and Gramsci's lengthy discussion of it in one of his letters from prison are quoted in Notebook 1, §44, n. 38.

The quotation is from Giosuè Carducci^ poem //Versaglia,, (Versailles), lines 51-52, composed in 1871. The poem is in Carducci^ Giambi ed Epodi, of which there are many editions going back to the 1880s.

On Giosuè Carducci, see Notebook 1, §44, n. 17.

2. Except for the parenthesis on Hegel as a source for ideas found in the Holy Family and the Theses on Feuerbach and the concluding sentences, the entire contents of this note are drawn from 〃La preistoria di un paragone” (The prehistory of a comparison), in Benedetto Croce's Conversazioni critiche^ 2d ser. (Bari: Laterza, 1918), pp. 292-94, of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi.

3. Derek Boothman points out that "the passage from Heine may be read in the Appendix (p. 267) to Kant's Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, ed. P. Cams, London, 1902: 'Mark this, ye proud men of action, ye are nothing but unconscious instruments of the men of thought who, often in the humblest seclusion, have appointed you to your inevitable task. Maximilian Robespierre was merely the hand of Jean-Jacques Rousseau7 〃 (Further Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. D・ Boothman [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995], p. 560 n. 39).

4. The introduction to section 3, "Recent German Philosophy,of the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, opens as follows:

In the philosophy of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, the revolution to which in Germany mind has in these latter days advanced, was formally thought out and expressed； the sequence of these philosophies shows the course which thought has taken. In this great epoch of the world's history, whose inmost essence is laid hold of in the philosophy of history, two nations only have played a part, the German and the French, and this in spite of their absolute opposition, or rather because they are so opposite. The other nations have taken no real inward part in the same, although politically they have indeed so done, both through their governments and their people. In Germany this principle has burst forth as thought, spirit, Notion； in France, in the form of actuality. In Germany, what there is of actuality comes to us as a force of external circumstances, and as a reaction against the same. (G. W.F. Hegel, Lectures on the History of Philosophy, trans. E. Haldane and EH. Simson [London: Kegan Paul, 1892-96], 3:409)

5. In the Philosophy of History, Hegel writes:

The metaphysical process by which this abstract Will develops itself, so as to attain a definite form of Freedom, and how Rights and Duties are evolved therefrom, this is not the place to discuss. It may however be remarked that the same principle obtained speculative recognition in Germany, in the Kantian Philosophy. According to it the simple unity of Self-consciousness, the Ego, constitutes the absolutely independent Freedom, and is the Fountain of all general conceptions—i.e. all conceptions elaborated by Thought—Theoretical Reason； and likewise of the highest of all practical determinations [or conceptions]—Practical Reason, as free and pure Will； and Rationality of Will is none other than the maintaining one's self in pure Freedom一willing this and this alone—Right purely for the sake of Right, Duty purely for the sake of Duty. Among the Germans this view assumed no other form than that of tranquil theory； but the French wished to give it practical effect. Two questions, therefore suggest themselves: Why did this principle of Freedom remain merely formal? And why did the French alone, and not the Germans, set about realizing it? (G. W.E Hegel, The Philosophy of History, trans. J. Sibree [New York: Dover, 1956], p. 443； interpolations in the original)

6. The relevant passage is quoted in Notebook i, §44, n. 38.

7. The reference is to the eleventh of the Theses on Feuerbach: "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways； the point, however, is to change it" (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 5, 1845-1847 [New York: International, 1975], p. 8).

8. In the introduction to the Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Marx wrote:

The criticism of the German philosophy of state and law, which attained its most consistent, richest, and final formulation through Hegel, is both a critical analysis of the modern state and of the reality connected with it, and the resolute negation of the German political and legal consciousness as practiced hereto, the most distinguished, most universal expression of which, raised to the level of a science, is the speculative philosophy of law itself. If the speculative philosophy of right, that abstract extravagant thinking on the modern state, the reality of which remains a thing of the beyond, if only beyond the Rhine, was possible only in Germany, inversely the German thought-image of the modern state which disregards real man was possible only because and insofar as the modern state itself disregards real man, or satisfies the whole of man only in imagination. In politics, the Germans thought what other nations did. Germany was their theoretical consciousness. (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 3, 1843-1844 [New York: International, 1975], p. 181)

9. Bertrando Spaventa/ "Paolottisnio, positivismo e razionalismo” (Bigotry, positivism, and rationalism) is reproduced in his collected philosophical writings； Scritti filosofici, ed. Giovanni Gentile (Naples: Morano, 1900).

On Bertrando Spaventa, see Notebook 4, §56, n. 5.

§209. Religion, the lottery, and the opium of the people
i. Matilde Serao's novel II paese di cuccagna (Milan: Treves, 1891) has gone through many editions and reprints, including recent ones； it was also translated into English as The Land of Cockayne (London: Heinemann, 1901).

The long novel is set in contemporary Naples and is about a lottery mania that pervades the city, ruining the lives of people from all social strata.

Matilda Serao (1856-1927) started her career as a journalist in Naples before moving to Rome, where she met and married Edoardo Scarfoglio (see Notebook 4, §68, n. i). Together, they launched the Corriere di Roma, and in 1892 they started a daily, Il mattino of Naples. In 1904 Serao (who had separated from Scarfoglio) started yet another newspaper in Naples, Il giorno. In addition to her regular newspaper articles and columns, Serao wrote a number of novels and short stories, of which II paese di cuccagna is arguably the most successful. Many of her works have been republished since the 1980s.

2. In the introduction to the Contribution to the Critique of Hegel/s Philosophy of Right, Marx wrote: "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of spiritless conditions. It is the opium of the people" (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 3, 1843-1844 [New York: International, 1975], p. 175).

3 ."This mania so generally condemned, has never been properly studied. No one has realized that it is the opium of the poor. Did not the lottery, the mightiest fairy in the world, work up magical hopes? The roll of the roulette wheel that made the gamblers glimpse masses of gold and delights did not last longer than a lightning flash； whereas the lottery spread the magnificent blaze of lightning over five whole days. Where is the social force today that, for forty sous, can make you happy for five days and bestow on you—at least in fancy—all the delights that civilization holds?” (Honoré de Balzac, A Bachelors Establishment, trans. Eithne Wilkins [New York: Farrar Strauss, 1952], p. 50).

This passage from Balzac's novel is quoted in French in Benedetto Croce, Conversazioni critiche, 2d ser, (Bari: Laterza, 1918), cited by Gramsci in the opening sentence of the note.

4. Matilde Serao, Il ventre di Napoli (Milan: Treves, 1884). This little book is a collection of articles on the life and mores of Naples that portray without sentimentality the wretched aspects of the city (or "the belly of Naples/ aslhe title calls it).

5. Croce's earlier essay "Matilde Serao,n from which these passages are quoted, was published in the third volume of his collection of literary criticism, La letteratura della nuova Italia (Bari: Laterza, 1915), pp. 33-72.

§210. History and antihistory
i. In his essay "Sudden Changes in Nature and History/' George V. Plekhanov quotes at some length from HegeFs Science of Logic in the course of a discussion of change and evolution:

nGradualistsof one kind or another, those who make a dogma of moderation and of meticulous order, cannot understand this phenomenon, although it was long ago brought into relief by German philosophy. Here, as on many other occasions, we shall do well to quote Hegel, who certainly cannot be charged with a passion for ^revolutionary activity.n He wrote: "The ordinary notion of the appearance or disappearance of anything, is the notion of a gradual appearance and disappearance. Nevertheless, there are transformations of being which are not only changes from one quantity to another, but also changes from the quantitative to the qualitative； such a transformation is an interruption of 'gradual becoming, and gives rise to a kind of being qualitatively different from the preceding. Every time that there is an interruption of 'gradual becoming/ there occurs a jump in the course of evolution, after which the place of one phenomenon has been occupied by another. Underlying the theory of gradualness is the idea that that which makes its appearance already exists effectively, and only remains imperceptible because it is so very small. In like manner, when we speak of the gradual disappearance of a phenomenon, we represent to ourselves that this disappearance is an accomplished fact and that the phenomenon which takes the place of the extant one already exists, but that neither the one nor the other is as yet perceptible. ... In this way, however, we are really suppressing all appearance and all disappearance. . . . To explain the appearance or disappearance of a given phenomenon by the gradualness of the transformation is absurdly tautological, for it implies that we consider as having already appeared or disappeared that which is actually in course of appearing or disappearing.(Wissenschaft der Logik, Vol. 1, pp. 313-314, in the Nuremberg edition of 1812.) This is equivalent to saying that if you had to explain the origin of the State, you would simply imagine a microscopic organization of the State which, gradually becoming larger, would at length make people aware of its existence. . . . One of HegeFs greatest merits was that he purged the doctrine of evolution of these absurdities. (G. Plekhanov, Fundamental Problems of Marxism, trans. Eden Paul and Cedar Paul (New York: International, 1929], pp. 104-5)

Gramsci had a copy of this text in the French translation of Plekhanov's volume: Les questions fondamentales du marxisme (Paris: Éditions Sociales Internationales, 1927).

On George V. Plekhanov, see Notebook 3/ §31, n. 4.

2. See Francesco De Sanctis's essay on Father Bresciani^ novel The Jew of Veronaf "L'Ebreo di Verona del padre Bresciani/ in Saggi critici, ed. P. Arcali (Milan: Treves, 1924), 1:91-115, of which Gramsci had a copy at Turi.

On Francesco De Sanctis, see Notebook 1, §96/ n. 3.

§212. Studies in economic history
1. See Notebook i, §29, n. 5.

2. See Edwin R. A. Seligman, The Economic Interpretation of History (New York: Columbia University Press, 1902). Gramsci may have been familiar with the French translation of this book that was published with an introduction by Georges Sorel: L1 interprétation économique de Phistoire (Paris: Rivière, 1907). In this case, however, it appears that Gramsci's query about Seligman's book was prompted by a passage in the same book by Plekhanov he had just alluded to in §210. Apropos of Seligman, Plekhanov writes:

However, the advantages which every investigator can derive from the Marxian method are so great that they are beginning to be openly avowed even by persons who have in other respects succumbed to the "conventional lie" of our time. Among these persons I may mention, for instance, Seligman, the American author of a book entitled The Economic Interpretation of History, published in 1902. Seligman frankly admits that what made other scientific investigators fight shy of the theory of materialism was the socialist deduction drawn from that theory by Marx. He considers, however, that we can make the omelette without breaking the eggs； that "one can be an 'economic materialist' and yet remain an extreme individualist." He goes on: "The fact that Marx's economics may be defective has no bearing on the truth or falsity of his philosophy of history.z,

In actual fact, Matx's economic views are intimately intertwined with his historical views. ... Let me add that Seligman, too, is sufficiently ^respectable^ to be afraid of materialism. This advocate of economic materialism considers that things are pushed to an intolerable extreme by those who have "sought the explanation of Christianity itself in economic facts alone. ”... Nevertheless, the very fact that Seligman's book has been written, and the nature of the author's reserves, give some ground for a belief that historical materialism一though it be in a truncated and "purified" form一will in the end be endorsed by the bourgeois ideologists who have not yet utterly renounced the hope of establishing order in their outlooks of history. (G. Plekhanov, Fundamental Problems of Marxism, trans. Eden Paul and Cedar Paul [New York: International, 1929], pp. 82-84)

Plekhanov also discusses Seligman in his essay "Karl Marx” (first published in Iskra on March i, 1903) that was anthologized in Karl Marx hommef pensem et révolutionnaìre, ed. D. Riazanov (Paris: Éditions Sociales Internationales, 1928).

2. In Fundamental Problems of Marxism (pp. 69-70), Plekhanov quotes a letter by Engels that describes the historiographial work of Jacques Thierry, Francois Mignet, and Francois Guizot as an adumbration of the materialist conception of history that would be "discovered" by Marx.

On Francois Guizot, see Notebook 7, §85, n. 1.

On Jacques Thierry, see Notebook 7, §50, n. 6.

Francois Mignet (1796-1884) gave up a professorship at the University of Avignon to devote his energies to politics through journalism. Through the newspaper he helped found, Le nationalf he promoted the protests against the repressive measures of Charles X that culminated in the July revolution of 1830, resulting in the accession to the throne of Louis-Philippe. Mignet returned to scholarship and produced a large body of historical work, including a history of the French Revolution.

3. On Henri Pirenne, see Notebook 5/ §68, n. 2.

In a letter from Ustica, Gramsci asked Tatiana Schucht to send him a copy of Les principales puissances d'aujourd'hui (Paris: Alcan, 1924), by Henri Busson, Joseph Fèvre, and Henri Hauser. At Turi, he had a copy of Henri Sée, Matérialisme historique et interpretation économique de Phistoire (Paris: M. Giard, 1927).

4. Friedrich List (1789-1846), a German economist who favored the imposition of tariffs on imported goods, moved to the United States in 1825, where he wrote Outlines of American Political Economy (Philadelphia, 1827). He returned to Germany in 1834 and after a series of financial setbacks moved to France and wrote his best-known work, Das nationale System der politischen Oekonomie (1841), which was translated into English as The National System of Political Economy (Philadelphia, 1856).

5 ・ The influence of Marxist thought is most evident in the earlier work of Werner Sombart (1863-1941), such as Dermoderne Kapitalismus {1902). Sombart became increasingly conservative in the course of his career, and by the mid-i93os he had embraced Nazi ideology. In one of his most interesting works, The Jew and Modern Capitalism (first published in 1911 and translated into English in 1913), Sombart argued against Max Weber's thesis that the spirit of capitalism was the outgrowth of the Protestant ethic； rather, he claimed, it was introduced into the northern European Protestant countries by Jews who had moved there to escape Catholic persecution.

2. See Benedetto Croce's "Religione e serenitàz, (Religion and peace of mind), in Etica e politica (Bari: Laterza, 1931). The opening paragraph of this little essay by Croce is translated in Notebook 7, §1, n. 9.

§214. The Popular Manual. Points on aesthetics and literary criticism
1. Gramsci is referring to Nikolai Bukharin's use of Goethe's poem ^Prometheus^ to reinforce a point he is making in the section "Society and Nature" in Historical Materialism: A System of Sociology (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1969), the book that Gramsci consistently refers to as the Popular Manual. The pertinent passage opens with the statement, 〃 A poetic expression of the growing power of man over nature, his active power, is given by Goethe in his poem ’Prometheus'" (p. 122). Bukharin then quotes the opening stanza of the poem (which Gramsci quotes later in this note) and then goes on to write: 〃It is therefore obvious that the differences in the natural conditions will explain the different evolution of the different nations, but not the course followed by the evolution of one and the same society" (p. 123).

2. This is a reference to Engels's letter of September 21, 1890, to Joseph Bloch； it is reproduced in Notebook 4, §26/ n. 1.

3. In the rest of the note, Gramsci makes extensive use of Leonello Vincenti^ article "Prometeo/ in Leonardo 3, no. 3 (March 1932): 97-101. The emphases and parenthetical interjections that occur in quotations from the article are Gramsci's.

It is important to bear in mind that the "Prometheus" ode is one of the poems by Goethe that Gramsci translated from the German in one of the notebooks (Notebook C in Valentino Gerratana^s classification) that he devoted to his translation exercises. Gramsci's translations are based on Goethe's texts reproduced in Über allen Gipflen Goethes Gedichte im Rahmen seines Lebens (Munich: Wilhelm Langewiesche-Brandt, 1922).

4. On Johann Kaspar Lavater, see Notebook 3, §75, n. 3.

5. J. W. von Goethe, Selected Works, trans. Michael Hamburger (New York: Knopf, 2000), p. 1069.

6. This translation is an adaptation (made to conform as closely as possible to Gramsci's Italian rendition) from two existing English versions: Goethe's Autobiography: Poetry and Truth from My Own Life, trans. R. O. Moon (Washington, D.C.: Public Affairs, 1949), pp. 566-67； and From My

Life. Poetry and Truth (parts 1-3), trans. Robert R. Heitner (New York: Suhrkamp, 1987), p. 469.

7. The question is Gramsci's interpolation.

8. See p. 574 of R.O. Moon's translation and p. 470 of Robert R. Heit-ner's version.

9. Gramsci is probably referring to a passage on Goethe that he translated from a small anthology of Marx's writings； edited by E. Drahnz Lohnarbeit und Kapital: Zur Judenfrage und andere Schriften aus der Frühzeit, 2d ed. (Leipzig: Verlag von Ph. Reclam, n.d.), on which, see the Description of the Manuscript of Notebook 7. The text that Gramsci translated was in fact attributed to Marx erroneously. It is a relatively small extract from an article by Engels, “Karl Grün: Über Goethe vom menschlichen Standpunkte/7 first published in several parts in the Deutsche Brüsseler Zeitung between November 21 and December 9, 1847. Gramsci translated the following fragment:

In his works, Goethe evinces an ambivalent attitude toward contemporary German society. Sometimes he is hostile toward it； he attempts to escape from what he finds repulsive in it, as in Iphigenie, and especially during his Italian journey； he rebels against it as Götz, Prometheus, and Faust； like Mephistopheles, he turns against it with the most bitter scorn. At other times, he is friendly toward it, he "accommodates" himself to itz as in the majority of the Zahme Xenien and many prose writings； he celebrates it, as in the Maskenzüge, even defends it against the oncoming movement of history, especially in all his writings that touch on the French Revolution. It is not just a question of Goethe accepting some aspects of German while others are repugnant to him. More frequently, it is a question of the different moods he is in； there is a continuing battle within him between the poet of genius who is repelled by the meanness of his environment and the cautious offspring of the Frankfurt patrician or the Weimar privy councilor who feels compelled to come to terms with and accustom himself to it. Goethe is thus a towering figure one moment and petty the next； at one moment, a proud, mocking genius full of contempt for the world and, at another moment, circumspect, temperate, narrow-minded.

For the complete text in English of Engels's multipart article, see Karl Marx and Frederick Engels； Collected Works, vol. 6, 184^-1848 (New York: International, 1975), pp. 249-73； the passage quoted above is on pp. 258-59.

2. The passage that Gramsci is referring to occurs very close to the end of chapter 19 of the 〃Boyhood〃 section of Leo Tolstoy's autobiographical book Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth. Gramsci quotes the passage verbatim in Notebook n, §57. He had a copy of the two-volume Italian translation of the work, Racconti autobiografici (Turin: Slavia, 1930), which he had asked Tatiana Schucht to send him in his letter of September 22, 1930.

§218. Alessandro Levi
1. Alessandro Levi (1881-1953), who studied law at the University of Padua, was intellectually a follower of Roberto Ardigò and politically an admirer of the socialist leader Filippo Turati. He made his mark early when his thesis on crime and punishment in Greek thought was published by a prestigious publisher and reviewed by Georges Sorel in Croce's journal La critica. Levi was a militant antifascist, and, being Jewish, he was prohibited from teaching by the racial laws of 1938. After the war, Levi's philosophical work and intellectual stature received formal recognition when he was made a member of the Accademia dei Lincei.

2. Gramsci's phrase is "secentismo filosofico,which can be translated literally as ^philosophical seventeenth-centuryism.n As the later version of this note makes clear, he is referring to the affectation and posturing associated with that period in which "witticisms and ready-made phrases pass for thought/7

3. In other words； Gramsci is suggesting； a critique of Gentile and his followers along the lines of Marx and Engels's critique of Bruno Bauer and other superficial thinkers in The Holy Family (1845).

Historical materialism, if it is to express something critically acceptable, can, as I have said elsewhere, be neither a new a priori notion of the philosophy of history, nor a new method of historical thought； it must simply be a canon of historical interpretation. This canon recommends that attention be directed to the so-called economic basis of society, in order that the forms and mutations of the latter may be better understood" [Histori-cal Materialism and the Economics of Karl Marx, trans. C. M. Meredith [London: Allen and Unwin, 1914], p. 77).

See Notebook 7, §1, n. 9.

Heine wrote: Z/God has not revealed anything that would lead us to believe there is life after death； nor does Moses say anything about it. Perhaps it does not sit well with God at all that the faithful are so thoroughly convinced that there is an afterlife. In his fatherly goodness, maybe he wants it to be a surprise" (Heine, Aphorismen und Fragmente, in Werke und Briefe, ed. Hans Kaufmann [Berlin: Aufbau, 1962], 7:402).

i. In the English edition of Bukharin's Historical Materialism, the preface is omitted. In the preface to the French edition that Gramsci was using in writing these notes； Bukharin explained that the book originated in discussions that took place during working meetings that he directed with J. Denikè:〃Cc livre est né des discussions engagées dans les conférences de travaux pratiques que Fauteur dirigeait avec J. Denikéz/ [La théorie du materialisms historique, 4th ed. [Paris: Sociales Internationales, 1927], p. 8).

§230. Religion, the lottery, and the opium of the people
i. Gramsci is referring to a letter that Engels wrote (sometime in early April 1888) to Elizabeth Harkness, author of the novel City Gid (published under the pseudonym John Low). A large part of the letter is about Balzac:

The more the [political] opinions of the author remain hidden, the better for the work of art. The realism I allude to may crop out even in spite of the author's opinions. Let me refer to an example. Balzac whom I consider a far greater master of realism than all the Zolas pas-sés, présents et à venir, in "La Comédie humaine" gives us a most wonderfully realistic history of French "Society,〃 especially of le monde parisien, describing, chronicle-fashion, almost year by year from 1816 to 1848 the progressive inroads of the rising bourgeoisie upon the society of nobles, that reconstituted itself after 1815 and that set up again, as far as it could, the standard of la vieille politesse frangaise. He describes how the last remnants of this, to him, model society gradually succumbed before the intrusion of the vulgar monied upstart, or were corrupted by him； how the grande dame whose conjugal infidelities were but a mode of asserting herself in perfect accordance with the way she had been disposed of in marriage, gave way to the bourgeoisie, who horned her husband for cash or cashmere； and around this central picture he groups a complete history of French Society from which, even in economic details (for instance the rearrangement of real and personal property after the Revolution) I have learned more than from all the professed historians, economists, and statisticians of the period together. Well, Balzac was politically a Legitimist； his great work is a constant elegy on the inevitable decay of good society, his sympathies are all with the class doomed to extinction. But for all that his satire is never keener, his irony never bitterer, than when he sets in motion the very men and women with whom he sympathizes most deeply—the nobles. And the only men of whom he always speaks with undisguised admiration, are his bitterest political antagonists, the republican heroes of the Cloitre Saint-Méry, the men, who at that time (1830-6) were indeed the representatives of the popular masses. That Balzac thus was compelled to go against his own class sympathies and political prejudices, that he saw the necessity of the downfall of his favourite nobles, and described them as people deserving no better fate； and that he saw the real men of the future where, for the time being, they alone were to be found一that I consider one of the greatest triumphs of Realism, and one of the grandest features in old Balzac. (K. Marx and F. Engels, Collected Works, vol. 48/ Engels: Correspondence, 1887-1890 [New York: International, 2001], pp. 166-67)

2. This is a transcription of Lanson's direct quotation of Pascal's Pen-sees, section 3 ("Of the Necessity of the Wager"§187: "Men despise religion； they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason； that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it； then we must make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true； finally, we must prove it is true,z (Blaise Pascal, Pensées, trans. W. F. Trotter [New York: Dutton, 1958], p. 52). See Gustave Lanson, Histoire de la littérature frangaise, 19th ed. (Paris: Hachette, n.d.), p. 464. The sentences in the rest of the paragraph are a paraphrase of Lanson's comments on this passage from Pascal.

§233. Points for an essay on Croce
i. In a speech he gave in parliament on July 7, 1920, Benedetto Croce (who was minister of education at the time) said that "to affirm, as I have done, that Christianity has created the moral life by which we still live, and that in this sense we are all Christians, is to state the obvious； it is the same as saying that Rome created law and Greece the literary arts and that all of us, whether Italian, French, or German, are in this sense Roman and Hellenic” (Croce, Pagine sparse [Naples: Ricciardi, 1943], 2:268).

Gramsci's source, however, was probably an article by Mariano D'Amelio, Società delle nazioni: Unificazione internazionale del diritto penale77 (League of Nations: International unification of criminal law), in the "Note e Rassegne” (Notes and reviews) section of Nuova antologia 67, no. 1441 (April I, 1932): 404-7. D'Amelio wrote:We must recall, first and foremost, Croce's simple and profound reflection that after Christ we are all Christians" (p. 406).

§234. etAppearances" and superstructures
I. Lorenzo Stecchetti was one of the pseudonyms of the postromantic, mannered, and at times morbid poet and literary critic Olindo Guerrini (1845-1916). Some of his writings were considered shocking.

§236. Points for an essay on Croce
1. See Benedetto Croce, Storia d'Europa nel secolo decimonono, id ed. (Bari: Laterza, 1932), which has been translated into English: History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century, trans. Henry Furst (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1933). When Gramsci wrote this note, sometime in late April or May 1932/ he did not yet have a copy of the book. In August 1932/ in fact, he drafted a petition (see Description of the Manuscript of Notebook 9) to be granted permission to read the book. Nevertheless, Gramsci had read the first three chapters of the book in Capitoli introduttivi di una Storia dell'Europa nel secolo decìmonono, which was published by the Accademia di Scienze Morali e Politiche della Società Reale di Napoli in 1931. He referred to it on April 18, 1932/ in a letter to Tatiana Schucht； see Notebook 8, §112, n. i. Additional chapters of Croce's Storia d'Europa also appeared in another publication of the Royal Society of Naples, Le rivoluzioni del 1848, il compimento del moto liberale nazionale e la crisi del 1870 (Naples, 1931)； Gramsci asked for a copy of it in his letter of January 25, 1932.

2. In his letter of May 9, 1932, to Tatiana Schucht, Gramsci wrote apropos of Croce's Storia d'Europa: "Is it possible to think of a unitary history of Europe that begins in 1815, that is, with the restoration? If a history of Europe can be written as the formation of an historical bloc, it cannot exclude the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars that are the 'ju・ ridical-economic, premise of the entire European historical complex, the moment of force and struggle. Croce takes up the following moment, the moment in which the previously unleashed forces found an equilibrium, underwent 'catharsis' so to speak, making of this moment an event apart on which he constructs his historical paradigm (Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, ed. F. Rosengarten, trans. R. Rosenthal [New York: Columbia University Press, 1994], 2:171-72).

3. On Vincenzo Cuoco, see Notebook i, §44, n. 2.

4. Gramsci is probably referring to §25 in this notebook. Valentino Ger-ratana suggests that the reference is to §36, also in this notebook.

§237. Introduction to the study of philosophy
1. See Benedetto Croce, La filosofia di Giambattista Vico (Bari: Laterza, 1911). The second edition of this work was published, also by Laterza, in 1922. On this book, see also Notebook 8, §199, n. 4.

2. See Niccolò Machiavelli, Il Principe, ed. Luigi Russo (Florence: Le Monnier, 1931). This volume is not preserved among Gramsci's books, but in a letter dated May 9, 1932, he informed Tatiana Schucht that he had received it.

3. Annotating the word "virtù," Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith write:

Literally "virtue” but in connection with Machiavelli better rendered by a word without moral overtones, such as "prowess.〃 In The Prince, Machiavelli sets up an opposition between fortuna (roughly—“circum・ stance") and virtù—the ability of the individual to act on and overcome the given world of circumstance. In Latin virtus meant an inherent quality such as (for example and in particular) military valour: Machiavelli tends to make it rather a quality of the will. The moral sense of the English word "virtue" evolved through an intermediary phase in Stoic and Early Christian thought where it meant "inner strength" and hence the ability to act well. {Selections from the Prison Notebooks, ed. and trans. Q. Hoare and G. Nowell Smith [New York: International, 1971], p. 41311)

4. This long parenthesis consists of an almost literal transcription of a passage in a note by Luigi Russo on p. 23 of his edition of Machiavelli's Prince.

5. This is from Russo's note on pp. 23-24 of his edition of the Prince. The emphases of ^naturalistic and mechanical character,/ and "trae meaning^ are Gramsci's.

6. Giovanni Gentile's Giordano Bruno e il pensiero del Rinascimento (Florence: Vallecchi, 1920) and Francesco Ercole's La politica di Machiavelli (Rome: Are, 1926) are cited in Russo's note on pp. 23-24 of his edition of the Prince. Before his arrest, Gramsci owned a copy of Ercoli's book on Machiavelli. He twice asked Tatiana Schucht to send it to him (in his letters of December 27, 1926, and April n, 1932), but there is no indication that he ever received it.
