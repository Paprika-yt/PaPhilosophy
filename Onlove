In this episode, I want to explore a truth about love that might seem a little unsettling at first: love always arrives too late. What do I mean by that? Well, think about it this way: we often don’t fully understand the depth of our love until the moment has already passed. It’s like the famous saying from the philosopher Hegel: “The owl of Minerva flies at dusk.” Just as the owl of wisdom only takes flight when the day is ending, we often only gain true insight into our love once the experience is behind us.

In a sense, we are always catching up to love, always realizing its significance in hindsight. And if we look at it from a Lacanian or psychoanalytic perspective, love is like a universal human symptom—something that happens to all of us, shaping our lives in ways we don’t always see clearly until later. Love, in this way, is both beautiful and a little tragic. It sneaks up on us, and by the time we recognize its full power, we may already be looking back on it.
Love and Time: A Tangled Dance

This brings us to the relationship between love and time. These two are deeply intertwined, almost like dance partners. When you’re in love, time can feel distorted—moments stretch out or blur together, and the ordinary becomes extraordinary. Think of Proust’s great work, In Search of Lost Time. That title could just as easily be In Search of Lost Love, because time and love are metaphors for each other.

Love has a strange way of making us fall in love with the past. We look back and realize that the most cherished memories are often the ones that didn’t seem important at the time. A simple walk, a quiet afternoon, or even something as mundane as eating beans on toast—these are the moments that, years later, we find ourselves longing for. And that’s the trick of love: it makes us pine for what we’ve already lost, for the time that has already slipped through our fingers.
The Heart of Melancholy

This brings us to the essence of melancholy—that deep, lingering sadness tied to loss. Melancholy isn’t just about feeling sad in the moment; it’s about the way we carry that sadness with us, long after the moment has passed. It’s heartbreak, yes, but it’s also the realization that time has moved on, and we can’t go back. That’s why the experience of time is so closely tied to the experience of loss.

When someone breaks up with you, or when you lose someone you love, it’s not just the person you miss—it’s the time you shared with them, the future you imagined, and the past that now feels impossibly distant. As the old saying goes, “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” Why? Because even though love can be painful, it’s the intensity of that pain that gives our lives richness and meaning. As Kafka once said, love is like a knife we twist within ourselves. It’s painful, yes, but it’s also what makes us human. Without pain, there can be no pleasure; without thirst, there can be no water.
The Illusion of Compatibility

Now, let’s talk about something that might surprise you: love isn’t always about compatibility. We often think that love is about finding someone who’s “perfect” for us—someone who fits our idea of the ideal partner. We have this notion of a “type,” someone who checks all the boxes: they look a certain way, share our interests, maybe even like the same music or movies. But here’s the thing: love isn’t about finding someone who fits into a neat little box.

In fact, the very idea of having a “type” can be a way of keeping love at a distance. When we say we’re looking for someone who meets certain criteria, what we’re really doing is protecting ourselves. We’re saying, “I want someone who won’t disrupt my world too much, someone who won’t change me.” But love does change us. It shakes us up, makes us see the world differently, and that can be scary. So, by focusing on finding someone who fits our “type,” we’re really trying to keep the messy, unpredictable nature of love at bay.
Love and the Fetish

This brings us to an idea from Lacan and Freud—the concept of the fetish. Now, when we hear “fetish,” we often think of something we’re obsessed with, like a particular object or desire. But for Lacan, a fetish is something that acts as a barrier—a way of keeping us from confronting something we don’t want to face. In the case of love, the “type” can be a kind of fetish. It’s a way of saying, “I want love, but only on my terms. I don’t want love to change me.”

Let me give you an example from psychoanalysis. The philosopher Žižek tells the story of a man who was deeply in love with his wife. They had a beautiful relationship, but tragically, she passed away in a sudden accident. The man never fully processed his grief. Instead, he became obsessively attached to a pet hamster. He cared for the hamster as if it were his wife, projecting all of his love onto this tiny creature. When the hamster eventually died, the man had a complete breakdown. He grieved for the hamster in a way he never did for his wife.

Why? Because the hamster was a coping mechanism. It allowed the man to avoid facing the full weight of his grief. The love he felt for the hamster wasn’t natural—it was a symptom of his unresolved pain. He wasn’t really in love with the hamster; he was using it as a way to avoid confronting the loss of his wife.
The Difference Between Melancholy and the Fetish

So, what’s the difference between melancholy and a fetish? With melancholy, you fall in love with your own pain. You hold onto it, almost as if you’re cherishing it. You keep revisiting the hurt because it’s become a part of who you are. With a fetish, on the other hand, you fall in love with something else—something that helps you avoid your pain. In the case of the man and his hamster, the hamster was his fetish. It was a way for him to avoid dealing with the real source of his grief: the loss of his wife.
The Beauty and Danger of Love

In the end, love is both beautiful and dangerous. It has the power to transform us, to make us see the world in new and unexpected ways. But it also has the power to hurt us, to leave us vulnerable and exposed. And that’s why we often try to protect ourselves by holding onto ideas like “types” or by finding distractions, like the man with his hamster. But real love—the kind that shakes us to our core—isn’t about safety or control. It’s about embracing the unknown, the unpredictable, and the transformative.

So, yes, love always arrives too late. We only understand its full power in hindsight. But maybe that’s what makes it so precious. It’s fleeting, it’s messy, and it’s often painful. But in the end, it’s what makes us human. It’s the knife we twist within ourselves, and yet, it’s the very thing that gives our lives meaning.

And that, my friends, is the paradox of love.

So, why is Sisyphus happy? Why would someone who is condemned to push a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down every time, be content with his fate? It seems absurd, doesn’t it? But that’s exactly the point. According to Camus, Sisyphus finds happiness within the absurdity of his situation. He embraces his fate, and in doing so, he transforms it.

Let’s break this down. Sisyphus, in his eternal struggle, could easily see himself as a victim of fate, as someone who is powerless, simply at the mercy of a cruel punishment. But instead, he flips the narrative. He makes a choice—not to stop rolling the boulder, not to escape his fate, but to embrace it. He decides that, rather than being a passive object of his suffering, he will become the active agent of his own destiny. In that moment, the boulder is no longer just a burden; it becomes the stage on which he asserts his own freedom.

And this is where Camus’ existentialism shines through: freedom is not something we are born with. It’s not something that exists in some pure, untouched form. Rather, freedom is something we create through our struggles. It’s something we discover in the face of the very things that seem to limit us. As Sartre once said, freedom is not about being able to do whatever you want. It’s about what you do with what has been done to you. In other words, freedom is reactive—it comes from how we respond to the challenges and constraints life throws our way.

This is a radical departure from the older, romantic idea of freedom. For the German Romantics, freedom was something pure and natural, something that existed in an ideal state before the world corrupted it. But for existentialists like Camus and Sartre, freedom doesn’t exist in some untouched, pre-destined form. It only emerges through the very struggles that seem to deny it. It’s not "I was free, and now I’m in chains." It’s "I am in chains, and through these chains, I will discover my freedom."

This is the paradox at the heart of Sisyphus’ happiness. He is bound to his fate, but within that fate, he finds the ability to assert his own agency. He reclaims his subjectivity. He is no longer just the man who rolls the boulder; he is the man who chooses to roll the boulder, and in that choice, he finds his freedom.
Love as a Truth Event

Now, let’s connect this to love. The French philosopher Alain Badiou argues that love is what he calls a truth event. A truth event is something that happens to you, something that seems to come out of nowhere, and yet reveals a deep truth about who you are. In this sense, love is not something you control. You don’t wake up one morning and decide, “Today, I will fall in love.” No, love happens to you. It hits you like a storm, a catastrophe, as Žižek would say. It turns your world upside down.

Before love, you might feel like you have everything figured out. You know who you are, what you want, what makes you happy. But when love strikes, it’s like a tsunami that sweeps away all your certainties. Suddenly, the things that used to bring you joy—your favorite foods, your hobbies, your routines—feel strangely empty unless you’re sharing them with this other person. Your sense of self becomes intertwined with theirs. You find yourself dependent on someone else’s presence, someone who was, until recently, a complete stranger. It’s as if this random person you met on the subway or in a café suddenly holds the key to your happiness. It’s both miraculous and terrifying.

This is why Plato described love as a kind of madness. In his Symposium, he talks about how all the vices of human nature—jealousy, insecurity, obsession—are awakened through love. Love has the power to make us vulnerable, to expose our weaknesses, to turn us into versions of ourselves that we might not always like. And yet, we crave it. We long for it, even though we know it will shake us to our core.
The Catastrophe of Love

Žižek takes this idea further, arguing that love is a catastrophe precisely because it disrupts the comfortable narrative we have about ourselves. It forces us to confront parts of ourselves that we might prefer to ignore. Love has a way of revealing our deepest insecurities, our hidden fears, and our unspoken desires. It’s not just a feeling of bliss or harmony. It’s a rupture, a breaking apart of the self, and that’s why it’s so profound.

And here’s the kicker: when we fall in love, it often feels like everything in our life has been leading up to that moment. Žižek calls this a retroactive necessity. It’s the experience of looking back at your life and thinking, “Of course, this is the person I was meant to meet. Everything I’ve done, everything I’ve experienced, was preparing me for this.” It’s as if love rewrites your past, making it seem like your entire life was leading up to this one, transformative encounter.

But of course, this is an illusion. Love feels like destiny, but it’s really just a random event that we give meaning to after the fact. And yet, that’s precisely what makes it so powerful. Love forces us to confront the contingency of our lives—the fact that so much of what happens to us is beyond our control—and yet, it also gives us the opportunity to embrace that contingency, to make it part of our story.
The Paradox of Love and Freedom

So, what does all of this have to do with Sisyphus? Just like Sisyphus, who finds freedom in the very act of rolling the boulder, we find freedom in love by embracing its unpredictability, its chaos, its potential for heartbreak. Love is not something we can control, but it’s something we can choose to commit to. We can choose to keep rolling the boulder, even though we know it might come crashing down. In that choice, we assert our freedom.

And this is the paradox of love: it is both a disaster and a revelation. It tears us apart, but it also reveals a deeper truth about who we are. It shows us that we are not just isolated individuals, but beings who are fundamentally interconnected with others. And in that realization, we find a new kind of freedom—not the freedom to do whatever we want, but the freedom to choose love, to embrace the vulnerability and uncertainty that come with it.

In the end, both Sisyphus and love teach us the same lesson: that true freedom comes not from escaping the struggles of life, but from embracing them. It’s in the act of choosing—choosing to roll the boulder, choosing to love—that we find our deepest sense of self. And that, my friends, is why Sisyphus is happy. He is in love with his own struggle, just as we are in love with the beautiful, messy, catastrophic experience of being human.

Let’s explore this fascinating concept of retroactive necessity. It’s the idea that, when you fall in love, it feels as though your entire life has been leading up to that moment. Every decision, every twist of fate, every seemingly random event suddenly feels like it was all part of a grand design, pushing you toward this one person. It’s as if the universe was conspiring to bring you to this point, and now, looking back, everything makes sense—like a puzzle that finally clicks into place.

But here’s the catch: this is an illusion. It’s a beautiful one, yes, but an illusion nonetheless. The truth is, life is full of randomness, full of chance encounters, and love is no different. That stranger you meet on the subway, the person you bump into at a café—they are not part of some preordained plan. And yet, when you fall in love, it feels as though they were always meant to be there, as if your life was a series of stepping stones leading to them. This is what Žižek calls retroactive necessity: the sense that love rewrites your past, making it seem as though everything was leading up to this one moment, even though it wasn’t.

And this is why breakups are so devastating. When you’ve convinced yourself that you’ve found "the one," that your entire life was building to this relationship, the end of that relationship feels like the end of your story. Suddenly, you’re lost. The narrative you’ve been telling yourself shatters, and you’re left wondering who you are without that person. You have to rewrite your own story, find a new path, and that can feel like rolling a new boulder up a hill—just like Sisyphus.

Because what is a relationship, really, if not the act of rolling the same boulder up the hill every single day? Love is not a completion, a final destination where everything is perfect and settled. No, love is repetition. It’s the daily process of choosing to love someone, over and over again, even when it’s hard, even when it feels like the boulder is too heavy. And yet, in that repetition, in that daily act of commitment, we find meaning. We find ourselves.
Love as Repetition

This brings us back to Sisyphus. He is not just a passive agent, endlessly rolling his boulder. He makes the active choice to embrace his fate. He finds meaning in the struggle, in the repetition, and that’s what makes him happy. In the same way, when we are in love, we are not just passive recipients of some grand romantic destiny. We are active participants in the process of love. We choose to love, day after day, and in that choice, we find happiness.

But here’s the thing: love is never smooth, never easy. It’s not some perfect harmony where A meets B and everything just clicks. There is always a tension in love, a disconnect, a gap between what we think love should be and what it actually is. Think about courtship—it’s full of uncertainty, full of moments where you’re not sure if the other person feels the same way, full of awkwardness and insecurity. You’re trying your best, but you’re never quite sure if you’re doing it right. And yet, somehow, because you’re not doing it “right,” you’re doing it exactly right.

This is the paradox of love: the only way to do it right is to do it wrong. Love is not about perfection or control. It’s about vulnerability, about opening yourself up to another person and embracing the messiness, the uncertainty, the not-knowing. And that’s what makes it so terrifying—and so beautiful.
The Dance of Courtship

Courtship, in this sense, is like a dance. You’re creating something together, something unique, something that no one else has danced before. And yet, at the same time, this dance is universal. Everyone who falls in love believes that they are inventing love for the first time. When you’re in love, you feel like no one else has ever experienced what you’re experiencing. It’s as if your love is the most singular, most unique thing in the world.

And yet, here’s the irony: everyone feels that way. Love is the most universal experience, and yet we all believe that our love is special, that no one else can understand it. This is the great paradox of love: it is both deeply personal and profoundly universal. We are all dancing the same dance, but we believe that we are the only ones who know the steps.

This is what Lacan meant when he said that the only universal is difference. The one thing we all have in common is that we believe our love is different, that no one else can understand what we’re going through. And in a way, that’s true. Each love story is unique, each relationship is its own world. But at the same time, love is the one thing that connects us all. We are all in love with difference, with the idea that our love is singular, that our experience is unlike anyone else’s.
The Imperfection of Love

And this is why love is never about finding the “perfect” person. There is no such thing as a perfect match, no ideal partner who will fit seamlessly into your life. Instead, love is about finding someone who is imperfectly perfect for you. It’s about recognizing that there will always be a disconnect, a gap, a tension—and choosing to love that person anyway. It’s about making it work, even when it’s hard, even when it doesn’t fit neatly into your idea of what love should be.

In the natural world, animals might find a mate through simple biological processes—pheromones, displays of strength, a quick mating ritual, and then they move on. But humans? We complicate things. We don’t just want a mate; we want a partner, a companion, someone who will challenge us and change us. And that’s what makes love so uniquely human. It’s not clean, it’s not easy, and it’s certainly not safe. Love is dangerous because it forces us to confront our deepest fears and insecurities. It makes us vulnerable in ways we never expected.
The Universality of Love

So, why do we do it? Why do we keep falling in love, knowing that it will make us vulnerable, knowing that it might end in heartbreak? Because love is what makes us human. It’s the one thing that connects us all, even in our differences. We are all searching for that connection, that sense of belonging, that feeling of being truly seen and understood by another person.

And in the end, this is the great truth of love: it is not about perfection or completion. It is about repetition. It is about the daily act of choosing to love, of rolling the boulder up the hill, even when it’s hard, even when it feels like it might come crashing down. Love is not something that happens once and then is done. It is something we create, day after day, through our actions, through our choices, through our willingness to embrace the messiness and uncertainty of it all.

And that, my friends, is why love—like Sisyphus—is both a struggle and a joy. It is the process of finding meaning in the repetition, of creating something beautiful out of the imperfect, and of discovering, in the act of loving another person, the deepest truths about ourselves.
