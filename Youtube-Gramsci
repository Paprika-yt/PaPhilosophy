Introduction,what is hegemony Antonio Gramsci and the,prison notebooks I'm Dillon south,Glasgow and I'm your lecturer for this,series in his prison notebooks Antonio,Gramsci,outlined one of the central tenets of,Marxist theorizing the notion of,hegemony for many years Marxist theorist,wanted to understand why the powerless,consent to be dominated by those in,positions of power and one of the ways,they came to understand it was through,the concept of hegemony while he was,What is Hegemony,imprisoned for promoting and,participating in subversive ideas,against the government,the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci,wrote a series of pamphlets called,simply the prison notebooks in them he,further developed the notion of hegemony,a Greek term meaning domination for,Gramsci the ruling class individuals in,positions of power and influence use,hegemonic ideas to gain domination over,the subjugated classes this hegemony of,ideas was not accomplished through using,force it was not accomplished through,using coercion it was accomplished,through getting consent from the masses,of ordinary people this consent was won,through using something called common,sense in other words Gramsci argued that,the ruling classes achieve domination by,manipulating language culture morality,and common sense by common sense we mean,the way that individuals look to common,sense to guide them in their immediate,private concerns as a result individual,common sensical approaches though,helpful in guiding the individual,through their local existence prevents,them from perceiving overarching,institutional socio economic,exploitation made possible by cultural,hegemony common sense means just the way,things are the way things have always,been in other words it does not,challenge the status quo but embraces it,as just common sense,accordingly individuals will not concern,themselves with social and economic,approach,and other areas of discontent in,political financial and social life,let's look at some examples of hegemonic,enterprises first the mass media in,Examples of Hegemony,recent times hegemony has become a,foundational part of mass media the,media is viewed as an independent and,impartial entity,however media have to follow a set of,guidelines and protocols while producing,any form of news since the media are,inherently commercial in nature they,must follow these given rules in order,to do business and to survive this,causes the introduction of a bias that,is favorable to the state and political,system that licenses the media,establishment therefore a partially,untrue version of events is put forth,for assimilation by the public we'll,talk about this more when we do our,special series on the mass media the,second example is the English language,its impact on education is seen by the,widespread use of English as the,language of instruction it has become,important to be proficient in the,English language if one is to excel,professionally this is reinforced by the,fact that majority of the elite,educational institutions provide,education only in English and do not,accept students who are not well versed,in the language this occurs to such an,extent that the knowledge of this,language has become synonymous to being,educated and intelligent and those,lacking it are deemed to be uneducated,and unintelligent the most common,example of hegemony can be observed in,the franchising and globalization of,world cuisine which involves franchises,like KFC Starbucks McDonald's etc it,also includes the practice of foreign,companies who produce products that will,sell well in the foreign market so let's,take a deeper look at the interdependent,and interrelated relationship between,the economically dominant and the,subordinated classes consent and,coercive force are integral,Gramsci argued that although it may not,seem like the ruling class is using,force to maintain its dominance,nevertheless force under writes the,appearance of consent in other words,Gramsci argued that it is a mistake to,think that the ruling class dominates,the subjugated class only by consent,that force is interchangeable with,consent one does not exist without the,other there is a constant negotiation,between the ruling class and the,subordinated classes about what societal,strivings are acceptable or not but for,Conclusion,the dominant class individuals who,possess all the power and all the,influence in a society the goal is,always to maintain ruling class ideas to,incubate societal resources negotiation,is not done through any altruistic,concern for bringing about equal justice,or a more equitable division of,resources or representation by,negotiating with the subjugated classes,the ruling class seeks to contain or,deflect any group or anyone who is,antagonistic when it comes to making,demands on the ruling class,indeed hegemony of the ruling class is,always at risk of being destabilized,this is especially true during times of,societal crises and collapse during,these times hegemony of the ruling class,is reconstituted and recomposed it is,made over so that it addresses the new,situation this kind of negotiation of,back and forth is a dynamic process it,is not static also it is not simply the,case that individuals in the,subordinated classes are brainwashed,neither is it the case that the ruling,class of Germany is on the verge of,collapse that is to say it is a,balancing exercise Gramsci and others,like black law and move revealed that,hegemony is a much more nuanced process,than this considered that workers in the,same economic situation may be naturally,inclined toward Sal,garetty in other words when it comes to,work and other activities there is a,natural bond through similar work,economic situation and other activity,but there is also a kind of accepted,notion of the ruling class ideas that,runs through the subjugated class and,that is perpetuated by the mass media,and other institutions of power in this,way ruling class ideas become pervasive,in a society even though some ideas may,be detrimental to the well-being of,ordinary workers so there remains a,continuous tension that is sometimes,evident and sometimes not,Gramsci and other Marxist theorists,argue that in rare cases because of the,experiences and the conditions under,which subjugated classes struggle this,tension may push subjugated classes in,to struggle against ruling class ideas,this may bring about revolution and with,revolution the notions of common sense,that subordinated classes have been,laboring under coming to conflict with,their everyday lived experience at this,time a new set of ideas politically,conscious and aware that reflect and,benefit the actual lived experience of,the subordinated classes may come into,me I'm dealers with class Co thanks for,watching,please like and subscribe,,


[Marxism After Marx | Gramsci: Language and Politics], something very historically unusual has, been happening for the past century at, an unprecedented pace languages around, the world have been disappearing by some, estimates we've been losing about one, language every three months for the past, hundred years by the end of the century, we may lose another 50, of the languages currently spoken, what is causing the erosion of, linguistic diversity you may have heard, this phrase before the world is getting, smaller what is generally meant by that, is that we are becoming globally, connected in a way that was never, possible before, an individual albeit a relatively, privileged one can board a flight and be, halfway around the world in less than a, day family members living on different, continents can communicate in real time, co-workers can hold meetings thousands, of miles apart, no doubt technological advances have, brought about a level of global, integration that has radically altered, how almost everything works, this process began around the decay of, feudalism in europe if you have not seen, the video on this channel covering, mercantilism you may find some useful, insights about the advent of capitalism, in late feudal europe, pre-capitalist societies were based, largely on immediate social relations, communities were small tight-knit and, fairly disconnected with the broader, world this all began to change as, commerce brought cities across the world, together the development of capitalism, shook up the feudal order forcing, disenfranchised peasants into larger, cities the proletarianization of the, masses was a homogenizing process, people began to identify less with, specific villages or counties and more, with an abstract national and class, culture, as a historical force capital has always, washed away differences leaving behind a, smooth surface where a rocky one used to, be, as smaller communities became, tributaries that flowed into larger, rivers dialects and local languages, disappeared for much of history people, did not see themselves as constituents, of so-called nation-states and yet by, the 19th and early 20th centuries, national identity was definitively, displacing self-affiliation with local, communities, this was the backdrop for antonio, Unification and Diversity, gramsci's views on unification and, diversity, the italy of the early 20th century was, precisely a battleground between a, nascent national identity and a series, of smaller and older regional loyalties, for gramsci language was an extremely, important medium through which these, tensions played out, sardinian at birth gramsci had, first-hand experience speaking what was, sometimes considered a dialect or, smaller language while also grasping the, increasing importance of italian like, many people of his time gramsci firmly, believed that the world was indeed, getting smaller and that the future for, not only italy but all of humanity was, unification, in this sense a unifying language was, considered as historically progressive, and politically desirable but as, alessandro carlucci writes gramsci was, staunchly opposed to the artificial, imposition of a language over others as, such gramsci was an avid proponent of, linguistic pluralism both because the, political struggles of diverse regions, could best be articulated in their, respective native tongues and because, the coercive assimilation of groups was, futile at best and destructive at worst, the main question was how to go about, striking a balance between diversity and, unification the tension between the two, poles unification and diversity can, never be entirely resolved, history does not destroy it simply, rearranges unity does not mean, uniformity and there may be a deeper, level of autonomy and diversity in a, future unified world than there is, within the present conflict written and, divided humanity, however the question of how to go about, reaching a standardized national, language involved delicate practical, implications, teachers needed to be aware of and, sensitive towards regional and local, particularities the issue was one of, respecting popular dialects or languages, without romanticizing them, in the end unification required planned, intervention but this intervention could, not work against the grain of organic, developments gramsci believed rigorous, and scientific evaluations of the, current linguistic transformations were, necessary to guide interventions, as a result the unified language will, not necessarily be specifically, preordained that is what we end up with, will never fully reflect the blueprints, Soviet Views and Policies, gramsci was able to experience some of, the most unprecedented language policies, in contemporary history during his time, in the early years of the soviet union, there too many thinkers were concerned, about the way linguistic and political, struggles were connected evgenia, pribrazenski and nikolai bukharin wrote, in the abc of communism that linguistic, oppression was a staple policy among the, empires of europe, national equality in a liberated workers, government must therefore recognize the, full linguistic rights of minority, groups, the tension of unification and diversity, was present at the conception of the, soviet state lenin who uncompromisingly, campaigned for the ethnolinguistic, rights of minorities in the former, russian empire nevertheless envisaged a, process of economic social and political, integration on an international scale, lenin believed this integration would, happen through rather than in spite of, multilingualism and multiculturalism, carlucci notes that this support for, multilingualism was organized around a, set of theoretical intuitions and, precise policy directives from lenin's, point of view unification and, integration develop and emerge, historically and cannot be imposed by, the coercive repression of diversity, unification can only mean voluntary, integration in connection with the, development of the economy and of, productive forces of society, furthermore an unbounded access to, democracy which lenin considered to be, the key to the integration of different, populations required the equality of all, languages, as such lenin firmly advocated for the, rights of groups no matter how small to, receive education in their native, languages and to use those languages in, public and state institutions, he went as far as to suggest that, institutional unity would be best, achieved through the use of multilingual, procedures in governmental and political, functions, soviet policy on language was ultimately, very closely tied to formation of new, nations, soviet policymakers worked closely with, linguists and sociologists to codify, systematize and promote minority, languages, at times however the zeal of the, scholars and the political motivations, of the party created boundaries where, none had existed before, the turkistan autonomous soviet, socialist republic for example was, dissolved into smaller republics out of, fears of a pan-turkist movement emerging, in the region, the grounds for the demarcations between, the republics were at least in part, motivated by linguistic differences that, were at times arbitrarily derived, gramsci believed that the russian, language was a unifying vehicle capable, of expressing the highest and most, universal achievements of world, intellectual culture, consequently the soviet policy of, ethnolinguistic demarcation was a, hindrance to the elevation of the masses, of course what was initially an, explosion of interest in linguistic, diversity gradually became reconfigured, on terms that favored the russian, language many languages including those, that had already begun the process of, latinization of their alphabets were, cyrillicized, though various degrees of linguistic, freedoms persisted throughout soviet, history russian continued to be the, dominant language for political and, academic discourse, for gramsci and others who valued, unification the standardization of, russian and educational and professional, spaces was not principally wrong, the main objection was that language, policies in the ussr often went against, the grain, gramsci theorized that linguistic, changes and political ones irradiated, from organic centers consequently, language planning ought to have, facilitated unification by maintaining a, careful awareness of spontaneous, developments, gramsci believed that diversity, including linguistic diversity could not, simply be denied bureaucratically, abolished or violently removed yet he, also believed that modernity offered, great opportunities for overcoming, cultural and linguistic cleavages in, that modern economic and cultural trends, would promote universal unification at a, national level and ultimately also at an, international level, the characteristics of the unified, language that was eventually to emerge, through this process of unification were, not entirely predictable and could not, be determined from the outset, what is especially interesting is that, the outcome of the gram sheen approach, doesn't presuppose the emergence of a, dominant language that is intact the, emergent language is clearly a synthesis, of languages a product of the organic, process of unification, Language in the Future, a hundred years have passed since the, observations of gramsci and his, contemporaries, regardless of what we think about the, supposed necessity of linguistic, unification history has demonstrated, that we are in fact moving towards a, world with fewer and fewer languages, capital moves at an accelerating pace, which brings us closer together with, every passing year, this interconnection however is not at, all innocent, the flows of capital transport certain, languages around the world while they, erase others, lucercla calls english the language of, imperialism for this reason, a single language suffices the language, spoken by the whole world because it is, the language of globalization and empire, those who have the good fortune or the, privilege to speak english as their, mother tongue do not need to learn a, second language unlike the unfortunate, natives of secondary languages and, dominated cultures or going even further, you need to know english and there's no, need to learn another language because, english is the language of imperialism, this pattern of consolidation may prompt, some to adopt an almost luddite reaction, to the invasion of english into other, languages expelling any influences or, loanwords simply because they are, derivative, but such responses are not necessary, and as gramsci would say impose, artificial constraints on an otherwise, organic process, english is the global lingua franca par, excellence only because of a specific, historical and social conjuncture, it's entirely possible that in the, process of becoming minoritarian as le, circle puts it english as a language of, imperialism will go the way of latin, outliving the empire and ultimately, dissolving into a family of related, languages, for our part we should forget the, obsession with purifying foreign, contaminants and focus rather on the, spaces where language struggles, articulate political and class tensions, around the world, foreign, , 

[Gramsci - Cultural Hegemony]hello everyone I'm Stephen West this is, philosophize this want to give a huge, thanks to the people on patreon that, make this show possible for everyone, else to listen to could never do this, without you today's episode is about, another area of discussion in the, political landscape of the early 20th, century the work of Antonio Gramsci I, hope you loved the show today so imagine, you're at a dinner party nice enough, person comes up to you, starts talking to you let's say the, conversation starts to go in the, direction of politics you talk for a, while, some point in the conversation you, decide to ask this person so what are, your particular feelings about politics, I mean where do you land on the whole, political spectrum imagine the person, replies with well actually I'm a, communist communism is the solution to, all of our political problems now to us, being people living in the 21st century, that have seen history play out the way, that it has no matter what you think, about communism we would instantly have, a lot of thoughts about this person and, probably a few questions we wanted to, ask them see because the word communism, carries with it an enormous amount of, baggage to us in the 21st century, baggage it's important to note that just, didn't exist when people were having, political discussions at the beginning, of the 20th century that's what I want, us to consider here at the beginning in, this episode just how much has changed, just how much has transpired since, philosophers were having these political, discussions at the beginning of the 20th, century what I want to do is try to take, a step outside of our 21st century, biases and try to do our best to put, ourselves in the shoes of someone, viewing the political landscape back, when communism was first being proposed, as a potential solution see because when, you do that you can start to see the, political philosophy of the time within, its proper context you can start to see, how in many ways the goals of the reform, democracy that we talked about last time, and the goals of the communism that was, being proposed back then were actually, incredibly similar remember at this, point in the timeline of discussion, about political philosophy there were, three major conversations that were, going on they were all trying to solve, the same general problems that existed, in political philosophy at the time one, was democracy one was communism and the, jhen, problem they were both trying to solve, was how do we ensure that in the future, society doesn't devolve into a situation, where a relative handful of people have, an inordinately which was a government, by the many not a handful of people, well communism was very similar in terms, of what it was aiming to do at the time, like we talked about we did the series, on the Frankfurt School for Neil Marxist, thinkers at the beginning of the 20th, century there was a short period of, confusion when it came to what exactly, was going on in the world, see Marx prophesized that very soon the, proletariat would realize that all they, had to lose were their chains and that, inevitably they would rise up they would, overthrow the Bush huazi and they would, implement a new system of economic order, let anyone who agrees with Marx at the, time cross their fingers and hope that, it ends up being communism but this, communist revolution just wasn't, happening in the West in almost every, case so what exactly was going on, neo-marxist thinkers went back to the, drawing board why does it make any sense, at all that people living in these, abject conditions working jobs that were, in many cases completely brutal why, would those people stand for it, why didn't Marx's prophecy come true, well very quickly the trend that emerged, in neo-marxist thought at the time was, that control over a population of people, extends far beyond the halls of Congress, or the ballot box political control is, almost always dictated by cultural, control this is why the Italian, philosopher Antonio Gramsci spends a, considerable amount of his work, exploring the concept of political, control and more specifically the very, important question of when there is a, dominant social group or a dominant, class within a society how exactly does, that group ascend to power and then, beyond that how do they maintain that, power once they've gotten it especially, when the social order that they promote, with that position of power is, oftentimes completely at odds with the, well-being of the average person the, fact is that, sometimes when a leader is elected they, don't pass policy that's necessarily, good for the majority of the population, sometimes they support policy that, really only benefits them or friends of, theirs that are fellow members of a, dominant social class Graham she wants, to find out why is it that these leaders, are sometimes capable of getting massive, support from the people for policies, that are actually hurting the average, citizen more than helping them how is it, possible that the proletariat can feel, so comfortable participating in a system, that keeps them in Chains in the eyes of, a neo-marxist thinker Graham she begins, his explanation by evoking and, repurposing a word that had been thrown, around all throughout human history but, it was a word that he thought in recent, years was starting to take on an, entirely new meaning the thing that was, responsible for allowing a particular, social class to ass into power and then, maintain that privileged status was what, he called cultural hegemony now this, concept of hegemony is gonna end up, being massively important to the, political conversation of the 20th and, 21st centuries overall and by the end of, this arc on the show we're gonna have, looked at it from a lot of different, perspectives but maybe the best place to, start is to talk about the origins of, the word the word hegemony originates in, ancient Greece, the root of the word comes from the, Greek word meaning to lead some, translators think it's closer to the, Greek word for to rule over but either, way, during antiquity there were things, called hegemon now in the context of, ancient Greece a hegemon was typically a, state that had a significant military, advantage over another state the, arrangement being that if the weaker, state didn't comply with certain demands, from the hegemon they would be annexed, or dominated militarily or burned to the, ground, take your pick I guess in other words, the term hegemony implied the threat of, physical dominance over a population of, people and this was the case all, throughout human history but Graham, she's gonna say that in our modern world, the definition of the word hegemony, needs to evolve with the political, reality we are living in we are no, longer living in a world where most, political control is exercised by, military dominance over a population of, people since the advent of mass media, people in positions of power have, realized that a much, more effective way of controlling, populations is by manipulating the, cultural parameters that citizens have, to navigate the general idea is this to, be a human being living a life in our, modern world at all you always have to, be living that life immersed within a, particular culture but what is a culture, other than an elaborate collection of, norms rules structures mores taboos, rituals values these things are not, exactly abstract concepts they are acute, they are visible this is the cultural, custom of a handshake to pay deference, to somebody else this is not talking, with your mouth full this is the sum, total of every ritual we engage in on a, daily basis that all come together to, create a cohesive society but what, Graham she's gonna ask is who exactly, created all of these norms and taboos, that we abide by we can easily look to, different cultures around the world, presently and all throughout human, history for that matter to see that a, culture can function and flourish when, things are completely different the, norms and taboos of a culture can be, completely alien from the modern world, that we're living in and yet things, still somehow managed to stay held, together so it makes grabs you wonder to, what extent is the current set of norms, and taboos serving to reinforce itself, to what extent are these citizens seeing, the current set of norms and taboos not, as a temporary instantiation of culture, but as just the way the world is once, again this is another example of this, classic debate we talked about last time, that's going to become increasingly, relevant how much of the reality of the, world can be explained by nature and how, much of the world can be explained by, culture this is extremely important, because to Graham Qi if you can control, the narrative and you can convince the, average citizen that the current set of, cultural norms is just the way the world, is then there's not going to be much, complaining there's not going to be much, in the way of seeking justice and trying, to change things this is similar to a, point we discussed from Simone de, Beauvoir and the ethics of ambiguity we, don't get mad at hurricanes when a, hurricane comes along and devastates, multiple cities people die homes are, destroyed billions of dollars in damages, thousands of families displaced and, every one of those cases a tragedy in, its own right but as human beings what, do we do we accept it why because, there's no sense in getting mad at a, hurricane there's no human intent or, will behind a giant storm nobody can be, held morally culpable, so we chalk it up as an unfortunate, series of events hurricanes are a part, of nature there's nothing we could, really do to stop it sometimes the world, is gonna be at large and I just got to, deal with that the best way I can and, try to accept it to gram Qi this is the, old switcheroo that's going on with, cultural hegemony dominant social, classes have the ability to dictate, cultural norms these cultural norms, oftentimes serve to reinforce themselves, and people born into these cultures, oftentimes view the normalized state of, the world around them as nature rather, than culture grand she thinks this is a, cultural story that's being told so, often citizens see it as just the way, the world is and something they need to, learn to accept - gram Qi this is why, Marx's prophecy hasn't come true this is, why the proletariat continues to live in, Chains because they've come to accept, those chains as the natural state of the, world that they need to come to terms, with cultural norms become to the, average person what Graham she calls the, quote common sense that they use to make, sense of their place in the world when, the common sense of your world serves to, legitimize the dominance of a particular, class of people and tells you that, anything you don't like about your, socio-economic situation well that's, just the natural order of things then, your very existence becomes reinforcing, of cultural hegemony you are reinforcing, the political status quo simply by, participating in the culture that you, happen to be born into this is why, people that would otherwise never stand, for getting pushed around can find, themselves getting worked into the, ground in a factory during the time of, Graham Chi, only to accept their place in the world, as a necessary part of how the world, works parts of my life may be hard yes, but you know what that's life life is, hard sometimes that's the sort of, dialogue that goes on in the working, class but look it's not like okay it's, not like Graham cheese saying that life, should never be hard here the more, accurate question, wiebe how hard does life need to be for, a person and how many hard aspects of, life have been made into a normalized, part of our modern world that we just, accept that disproportionately served to, benefit a dominant group within society, being a neo-marxist you can no doubt, guess what his first and most commonly, used target is throughout his work, capitalism so to graham qi even people, that are struggling within a capitalist, system have oftentimes lived their, entire lives immersed in a culture that, promotes the merits of capitalism this, in turn creates a sort of economic, Stockholm Syndrome where despite the, fact they're struggling the citizens, identify themselves and their place in, the world in relation to capitalist, ideology when the entire way that you, view the world has been given to you by, a culture that benefits from maintaining, capitalism Gramps you would say don't be, surprised if that education produces a, few blind spots these blind spots are, the point ok cultural hegemony in many, ways is accomplished by getting consent, from the population to keep things the, way that they are by making sure people, are blind to other options at their, disposal keep in mind as we continue, talking about cultural hegemony that, this isn't always accomplished by an, organized group of people that are, actively trying to control things, cultural hegemony can exist and people, can be a part of perpetuating that, status quo just simply by acting out of, their own self-interest see because, their self-interest is always considered, in relation to how the current system, can help them they unintentionally end, up supporting things staying the same, what Graham she's getting at is that for, any single person or any social, institution to appeal to groups that are, in positions of power for the sake of, your own self-interest you must in some, capacity there go along with the way, that things are currently structured so, for example if you're a politician or a, social commentator that wants to make, the world a better place the only way, you are ever going to be able to get, your message across is by participating, in the existing culture and using the, tools at your disposal this is an ideal, situation for cultural hegemony and one, of the goals of its final stage is to, grab Qi to make the values of a, particular culture seem so, part of nature and so in line with quote, common sense that the members of that, culture don't even question them anymore, to get people completely entrenched in, this world where they mistake the, reality of their culture for the reality, of the universe to think the reason, things are staying the way that they are, is because people are weighing all the, options they're thinking about it for a, while and then they're making the best, choice not merely complying with the, demands of a cultural hegemon that has, control over them that said just like, the militaristic hegemon of ancient, Greece the goal of cultural hegemony is, to stay in power now over time dominant, social groups have realized that the, most efficient way of doing this is by, controlling people's systems of values, Ramsey thinks by and large people, acquire their systems of values by, listening to and studying voices within, a culture that he thinks are massively, important public intellectuals Graham, she makes an important distinction here, between two very different types of, public intellectuals there are ruling, intellectuals and organic intellectuals, now the ruling intellectuals are going, to be the sort of foot soldiers for the, dominant set of cultural norms that are, currently in place these are the people, whose commentary on the world is going, to reinforce the status quo keep in mind, again this is in no way saying that, these are bad people necessarily most of, them may not even realize what they're, doing but Graham Qi nonetheless wants to, shine a light on the insular and, oftentimes self-reinforcing world that, many of these intellectuals come from so, often it's from academia so often these, people are completely out of touch when, it comes to what life is even like for, most people in a culture think about the, common archetype of a philosopher, throughout history philosopher decides, are gonna resign themselves from public, life lock themselves away in a tower and, just think about stuff really really, hard that's the path for creating better, philosophy you know the last thing you'd, ever want to do as a philosopher is have, the basic thoughts of a normal everyday, person corrupting your unparalleled, genius right graham she thinks this is, completely ridiculous not only is this, elitist and making tons of value, judgments about how certain human, experiences of the world are inherently, better and can even be corrupted by, other people's experiences of the world, but aside from all that gram she thinks, this approach actually prevents you from, ever being able to participate in, discussions about politics at all, because political discussions always, begin from the starting point of, self-awareness and self-reflection while, considering how that self relates to all, the other people around you and how, could anybody locking themselves away in, a closet thinking about stuff ever hope, to contribute to that conversation but, nonetheless these ruling intellectuals, often times dominate the ideas that are, available to citizens of a society I, mean so often these intellectuals are, the ones that write the articles they're, the ones published in journals they, conduct the studies they write the, textbooks so often these intellectuals, control the education of the next, generation of citizens when so much of, their prominence as an intellectual was, only given to them simply because their, ideas correspondent with the existing, social order here's what Graham she's, saying cultural hegemony is established, by taking control of three things the, intellectuals of a society the education, within a society and the philosophy that, drives people to political action so in, other words if you're someone that came, up through the education system of an, advanced capitalist society Graham she, would say don't be surprised if there, are some pretty glaring holes in your, understanding of capitalism, because just statistically most pieces, of information you've ever had access to, have been written by people that reach, that level of social influence by, participating in a capitalist system, that benefits them your high school or, university wasn't taught by unbiased, monks on the top of a mountain that most, likely once again just statistically you, have come up in a world where you are, far more likely to hear about the merits, of capitalism and all the good that it's, doing for people in the world when, conversations about the downsides of, capitalism come up you're far more, likely to hear them glossed over by, other people you're less likely to have, someone call you out for glossing over, them and the conversation is likely to, go in the direction of how the good of, capitalism drastically outweighs the bad, when you hear people talking about, socialism when coming up in an advanced, capitalist culture you're far more, likely to run into conversations about, the horrors of socialism how its failed, everywhere it's been tried and if anyone, brings up something good that so, seems to have produced it's written off, as broken clocks right twice a day sort, of thing now here's the really, interesting part this view of economics, and how it plays out in the world may be, absolutely true capitalism could just be, a better economic system than socialism, but how would you ever know for sure, because if you're an intellectually, honest person you'd at least for a, second have to consider that maybe your, entire understanding of capitalism and, socialism has been given to you by a, handful of intellectuals you've, entrusted your worldview to that our, intellectuals and gained their, credibility simply because their view of, the way the world is corresponds with, the dominant cultural narrative that, keeps the status quo going whether, maintaining that status quo is good for, a particular social group that's pulling, the puppet strings or whether it's good, for just keeping society stable what if, you've lived your entire life learning, from a lot of really smart people that, are all just telling the same side of, the story now Graham she would say that, this is not just limited to capitalist, societies that it's entirely possible to, come up in a society that unfairly, promotes the merits of socialism and, creates the same sort of echo chamber of, ideas graham cheese goal was not to, replace a Western world dominated by, capitalist ideology with one dominated, by Marxist ideology his goal was to, replace both of these narrow approaches, with an ideology where the public has a, general and intense level of skepticism, about the status quo no matter what the, status quo looks like the biggest, mistake we can make to graham qi is to, see these ideologies as nature or the, way that things are we should always be, critical of the status quo and the fact, he's so critical of capitalism is just, him following his own advice about the, status quo of the world he happened to, live in to make a long story short, graham she thought that marx and so many, other marxist thinkers that came after, him we're putting the cart before the, horse in a way they were also wrapped up, in the possibility the inevitability of, a communist revolution in the West they, were so wrapped up in waiting to see, capitalism destroy itself that they, completely missed the fact that, different methods of cultural control, could fragment a population to the point, that a revolution could never take, Grahame she makes another important, distinction in his work directly to, these people that were calling for, revolution that for any meaningful, social change to ever take place, regardless of what it is there needs to, be two wars that are fought in one first, a war of position then a war of, manoeuvre these Orthodox Marxists of his, time were far too focused on the war of, maneuver which was the actual communist, revolution that they wanted to bring, about but Graham she says before that, can ever happen you need to defeat the, cultural hegemon in a war of position, remember a cultural hegemon will have, control over three things the, intellectuals the education and the, philosophy of a society the goal of, anyone trying to bring about any kind of, social change to graham qi should be to, provide alternatives in all three of, these areas they should create a, counterculture an alternative set of, cultural norms and taboos reinforced by, the intellectuals whose job it is to, actively challenge the status quo, he called this other type of, intellectuals organic intellectuals and, it was their job to be skeptical of the, existing order of things to provide an, alternative means of education that took, cues from the counterculture that was, created and to embolden the average, citizen to take political action by, giving them a philosophical outlook that, changes the way they see themselves and, how they fit into the world this is why, so many attempts at revolution have, failed in the past two graham qi the, orthodox Marxist that tried to organize, it didn't understand the common sense of, the workers that needed to carry out the, revolution these workers saw themselves, and their place in the world solely in, terms of how they relate to capitalist, ideology the only way to shift their, perspective enough to see the other side, would be to fundamentally change the way, they look at the world philosophically, see an extremely important term in the, work of Karl Marx it was used to, describe the way he saw things was, historical materialism gram Chi was a, neo-marxist when it came to these, orthodox Marxist that we're talking, about he distanced himself considerably, from them and a big reason why was, because he thought they were paying way, too much attention to the materialism, part of historical materialism and not, nearly enough attention to the, historical part of it, Grahame she may have supported communism, and communism may have played out in a, particular way all throughout the 20th, century but graham she hated stalin he, would have hated Mao he would have hated, Pol Pot he saw people like these as, opportunistic dictators that took what, could otherwise have been a, revolutionary political philosophy and, they used it to create dictatorships, where the population was forced to deify, and worship the state when two gram Chi, a much more accurate reading of the work, of Marx would have produced the true, essence of his work the spirit of, revolution among people the spirit of, revolution among common people united, under the desire to never again allow a, handful of people to dominate and, control the population to those living, at the time of graham chee communism and, democracy seemed to be two extremely, different approaches to trying to solve, the same general problem see as we, already know from earlier episodes the, feeling around this time in the world of, philosophy is an intense skepticism, towards reason the Enlightenment gave us, the hope that science was the answer, science when given enough time to, develop was capable of giving us answers, to problems that throughout history have, seemed completely unsolvable when, applied to the realm of political, philosophy for over a hundred years it, seemed totally plausible that something, like science something as unbiased and, without an agenda as science could, eventually study the way that people are, study their brains study the way people, work together within a society and it, didn't seem crazy to think that science, could eventually give us answers to some, of these questions and political, philosophy that seemed so difficult to, answer but Along Came Frederick, Nietzsche philosophizing with a hammer, because at the end of the 19th century, he asked the question what if the very, act of conducting science at all carries, with it cultural values that narrow and, distort its findings we know there are, many different ways of conducting, science depending on the specific field, you're in we know that scientific, revolutions have occurred or there have, been wholesale transformations of the, methods and assumptions that science is, conducted through what if these, limitations and the unavoidable narrow, scope that categorizing the universe, must be viewed through is missing out on, something, crucial about what it is to be a human, being what if science useful as it is, was never the savior that everyone, thought it was more on that next episode, thank you for listen, , 

Introduction, foreign [Music], Lindsay you are listening to the new discourses podcast and today I want to tell you about a person his name is, Antonio gramshi Antonio Graham she is a very important character in fact he's probably the linchpin, between historical marks and present day everything, Antonio Gramsci, on the left that's gone out of control anyway present-day leftism Antonio gramsci, um I don't really have by the way super detailed notes about this but I just kind of want to give you a picture of how important this guy is he was an, Italian Marxist he was jailed in the 1920s um 1926 specifically by the Italian, fascists most people don't realize given how how brutal brutally fascistic, communist regimes turn out to be but the Communists and the fascists in the 1920s, and 1930s were not quite on the same side when they jailed him they said that, his that they needed to silence his mind for 20 years um gramshi if you've been following some, of my other stuff I've been working on you'll not be terribly surprised to find out was not in great health he was, ravaged by disease it left him deformed uh, very sickly very bad health problems had a hard time being able to fit into an, industrial society very linguistically skilled so here we have a misfit who was linguistically skilled who was an Ardent, communist what a shock um but anyway when he was in prison they didn't manage to silence his mind he, Prison Notebooks, wrote copiously between 1929 and 1935 he died shortly thereafter, and did the collection of things he wrote has been published is referred to as his prison notebooks, uh they were in Italian obviously they were known to the critical theorists, in the Frankfurt School it's likely they would have been known I don't know for sure but it's probable that they were, known to the French post-modernists they were not however translated into English until 1970 and they were translated at, Notre Dame by a translating group led by Joseph Buddha judge who is the father of, Mayor Pete Buddha judge um which is an interesting little, connection so one of gramshi's lines just to kind of contextualize how he, thought about this was that socialism this is a quote socialism is precisely the religion that most overwhelm, Christianity so gramshi is often credited as the guy who's the Long March to the institutions, guy even though that's he's not the one who called it that he is the one however who should be credited with the, development of cultural Marxism of course lucach and the guys in the, early guys in the Frankfurt School were also poking at cultural issues but they're much more interested in uh, Freudian psychoanalysis and Weber's sociology trying to apply that to Marx, gramshi was the one who really understood and his this is his idea the cultural hegemony idea it was his key, pillar that holds up the capitalist Society for cramshi is cultural hegemony, cultural hegemony is kind of like this feeling like you have to go along with the culture in fact there's a lot of, pressure that you have to conform to the culture and so gramshi's claim being Marxist was that the elites the, bourgeoisie in society created intentionally ideologies and the, dominant culture to keep people trapped in their way of thinking way of, approaching the world in other words to keep them upholding capitalism that's the source of the false, consciousness that became prominent in the Frankfurt School critical theory analysis that people have, um so gramshi is a major major figure he had some other Big Ideas uh he was huge, on the idea that there are certain pillars of culture that have to be taken on religion family education media law, so he was very very uh clear in his belief that those are the, places these sites of cultural production where something has to happen where there has, to be this critique there has to be this you have to tear those things down in order to make way for the revolution if, you're going to have it in western democracies which are not working out well for communist, Revolutions in the 1920s in fact that was the big question of the era for the for the marxists why isn't Marxism, taking he was also big on creating this idea that the working class needed its own culture and they needed their own, intellectuals working class intellectuals working class education this is what led directly and I mean in, a very straight line both in the Brazilian context under Apollo Ferrari and in the American context under people, like Michael Apple leading in Henry Drew who also discovered Ferrari later to critical pedagogy so taking over our, education system with Marxist ideology can be traced back very directly to, Antonio gramsci uh he had this idea that Society is split between the political, society and the Civil Society he was a big fan of historicism we'll talk about that a bit but that's basically kind of, the way that Hegel and Marx saw history unfolding uh through the action of activists, really um he was against Marx's later ideas like, Indus capital of what he referred to as economism he didn't believe that it was, an inevitability for example that the working class would become conscious, by the just the machinations of capitalism as Marx had posited in Das Capital he believed instead that there, would have to be agitation and in fact he believed in a two-phase revolution which we're kind of seeing right now where there's a cultural revolution, paired with a uh kind of a hard revolution in a classical sense after the cultural revolution has weakened the, culture enough to allow it so you can kind of see gramshi's relevance right, now we we are going through China went through a cultural revolution and then Mao was able to come in and seize power, and instant apples to CCP we are going through a cultural revolution right now, and the political power will follow that so gramshi's often credited with this, idea that politics is Downstream from culture and as I said a moment ago you can tell he also understood that the the, culture is Downstream from economic from education so he was very interested in, in those things he also had uh some negative thoughts on on objectivity um he was actually anti-objective and, that he was a very strict historicist so he thought that everything was contextual to the time and I guess place in which, uh it it arose so um his biggest influence I am going, Early Influences, to continue to talk more and more about the influence of Hegel and his phenomenology of spirit so the early, Hegel the so-called young Hegel uh especially on the young Marx which, differs from the old marks as maybe you've picked up a little bit from what I've just said well, Graham she's one of his chief influences um was a another Italian thinker perhaps, one of the most famous and influential Italian thinkers of the time Antonio lambrilia uh La brolia let me pronounce, that correctly um and another thinker uh benedetto Croce then, these guys were especially Croce was particularly, um an idealist an Italian idealist so he was influenced in the same kind of Malu that you would see hegelian and even, kanchian thought librolia was very much a young hegelian, he was a outright hegelian Marxist and so these thoughts as transmitted largely, through gramshi were incredibly influential on a much more famous name Leon Trotsky and the trotskiest style or, trotskyite style approach to socialism um grams she was uh enamored with Lenin, Gramsci and Lenin, and he actually um kind of had a hole falling out with, various people when he tried to uh indicate how Stalin had kind of deviated, from Lenin uh but he kind of it was it was a complicated, um a complicated critique because he largely agreed with what Stalin was, doing but thought Stalin was going too far which is obviously correct and so in a sense you could say that cramshi was a, leninist style person in other words he believed in particular and this is I guess a starting point for kind of his, his historical background he was watching he believed in particular that the leninist style approached was going, to be necessary in other words there was going to be the need to form a Communist party out of intellectual Elites, very much like Lenin advocated if you don't understand londonism we may have to take a short sidebar into into that, but what Graham she saw was that the Italian workers parties were not forming, a nice powerful political block like Marx would have predicted and Lenin was providing the answer to, that or had provided an answer to that in the form of his party style or Communist party style, approach and so just as a very short aside in in kind of very broad Strokes, leninism is this idea that the proletariat are not going to wake up for themselves so they need this group, of Elites technically people within the bourgeoisie are so rich people who have lots of, spare time and lots of angst against the society that are going to then become deep into, The Communist Party, the ideology of Marxism and then they will Shepherd the proletariat through the revolution, so you can see this is where the party the Orwell talks about the party as in, terms of the Soviets the party in terms of the CCP in China that's where all this comes from there's this idea that, these people have to appoint themselves as the revolutionary leaders, and every time these people just March societies into the blender because it, doesn't work as I've written elsewhere and talked about elsewhere they are constructing a pseudo-reality, Marxism has some interesting critiques of society and capitalism has some interesting development of something, hegel's ideas it has some interesting views of its own but it doesn't work, it just doesn't work it's not compatible with human nature it's not compatible, with the way that we actually allocate resources if you talk about a material economic sense, it has to be forced on people and it gets forced on people by these parties this is leninism it gets for some people, by these parties who are Elite enough to understand the rarified air of Marxist, theory and then we'll Shepherd the proletariat through the revolution which in practice means shipping them off to, gulags or Killing Fields or letting half of the population of China starve or whatever it is, never works out because it's all based in poppycock it's pseudo-reality it is a pseudo-real, description that misunderstands all of the fundamental premises of how societies are organized so gram sheet I, want to posit is sort of the link between, that and now okay so gramshi becomes extremely, relevant in the fact that his prison notebooks in particular link that leninist style thought to, understanding that there has to be a cultural revolution to make it work so the only at the time we're talking the, 1920s the only Communist Revolution that had worked was the Bolshevik Revolution, with Lenin at the helm in Russia there was the attempt in Hungary by George lucach that fell apart, Lou Koch got pissed off about this went to Germany founded the Frankfurt School eventually Incorporated many a gramshi's, ideas but the only Communist Revolution that had worked all these years after Marx had predicted, its inevitability was was the Bolshevik Revolution in in Russia and, Cultural Hegemony, under Lenin and so gramshi figured that something must be going on that's right, there and what he figured out why aren't the question was why aren't these things happening in the west why are they not, happening in Germany why are they not happening in Italy why are they not happening in England apparently they, believed these were societies especially England was apparently supposed to be a society that was ripe according to, Marx's theory of the capitalism evolving into socialism naturally and it just, wasn't happening and gramshi blamed culture he said that basically these, countries had too strong of culture they weren't just a bunch of Russian peasants they were a people who were clear-eyed, about who they were and they had lots of deep cultural roots, and they had very effective institutions for transmitting their cultural roots and that established what would you, would call a cultural hegemony that would be characterized as common sense, that would then maintain the so-called status quo in other words not allow it to become Marxist, for him culture was the collection of Bourgeois values their culture meant, especially at the time it didn't mean necessarily you hadn't really had the uh cultural anthropologists coming through, and kind of changing the meaning of the word culture referred to like art literature speaking properly knowing how, to dine the refined aspects of participating in culture so they were, identified with Bourgeois values and the idea was that these Bourgeois, values and the promotion of these Bourgeois values and the ideologies of the countries like nationalism and so on, that uphold these Bourgeois values prevent a class Consciousness from arising that was gram Sheet's kind of, key idea and he called this cultural hegemony that's what prevented the so-called as, Marx predicted the inevitable uh proletarian revolutions from taking place they were not inevitable grahamshi, realized because culture first had to be dissolved and so this breaking down of culture, became the first and most important project so now you you have this split in in communist thought starting with, gramshi very clearly where he saw Lenin had done something right but more importantly he realized, that culture was the roadblock everywhere else to where now you're going to split into having a two-stage, Revolution a cultural revolution that eventually demoralizes the people and then when, that is sufficiently done then this party can step in and seize power, because the culture is not strong enough and the people who are within that culture are not unified enough to be, able to resist the revolution it's a really nasty but also very, effective tactic that as I've spoken about in other places liberalism is particularly susceptible to, um in fact liberalism is particularly susceptible to it because liberalism takes everything every argument is, charitably as possible and therefore it can't conceive of the idea that the goal of the Communists is to, destroy the thing it can't conceive of the idea that legitimately Psychopathic people are, creating pseudo-real descriptions just to manipulate people in order to gain their own power because they think it, will lead to a utopian Revolution and I mean that quite literally you can read Max horkheimer, um his his essay critical traditional and critical theory written in 1937 he's, one of the kind of Cornerstone guys of the Frankfurt School he explicitly says, in the essay that um without having a utopian Vision that, critical theory just kind of does useless things it has to be done in, service to a utopian vision and that utopian vision is of course for all these people Marxist, um because they were all marxists and they had their criticisms of later marks this, is a fun little trick so you can say oh well they were against Marxism they were vicious critics of Marx they were not, against the early Marx who was basically taking hegel's ideas hegel's religion, frankly and channeling it into material Society in in terms of, conflict theory between the the the working class and everybody else, um so he held then uh that having ideological and cultural control of the, people is Central to being able to achieve the revolution which would proceed in two stages first the culture, then there would be an attempt made through violence and whatever else to, overthrow the existing power structures although ideally you would just be able to infiltrate, and the the coup would be soft no need to necessarily get violent no need to, get messy here you would just fully infiltrate the culture of the existing institutions those institutions he saw, that held up the pillars of culture as he as he would see it in other words the domains of cultural, production where Marx was interested in the domains and seizing the domains of economic production for he says the, workers and the people that's BS we know it's BS what he really meant was for his the party the the elites that are real, like himself that were going to guide Society uh and Rural Society, um Graham she understood that you have to seize the means of cultural production and the places he saw that, were most relevant were religion in the churches so you had to get this ideology into the churches you had to start, dismantling Christianity if it's a Christian dominant, or country or or culture you have to start dismantling Judaism you have to start dismantling even Islam if you, wanted to do it there if you were in China you would dismantle Confucianism and even some of the Buddhists in Dallas thought just like Mao did, just like mounted so Mao you could think of by the way is like Lenin 3.0 Stalin would be like, Lenin 2.0 and this cultural revolution idea of gramshi had a lot to do with, that that's how Mao proceeded so you're going to take apart the religion you're going to get into the, church as we see this now this woke BS has infiltrated like every, one of the major religious institutions it has infiltrated the Southern Baptist convention, thanks to myself and a couple of other people uh I don't want to say a couple there's dozen so a couple dozen maybe, people really fighting back um we have pushed the Southern Baptist convention, to the point where they are now pretending to and I want to really emphasize that pretending to repudiate, this we're pretending to repudiate uh critical race Theory and intersectionality meanwhile if you read, what their statement was they're saying oh we're against critical race to your intersectionality but basically we're, just going to keep doing the same thing we're still going to acknowledge systemic racism we're still going to acknowledge the history of racism and, pretend it has significant relevance today we're still just going to do all the things that critical race Theory would do we just won't call it that very, same trick is when Trump issued the executive order that banned lots of divisive teachings that come out of, critical race Theory uh he didn't actually ban critical race theory if you read the freaking order it still says in, section 10 that you can teach it it still says you can have diversity training but you saw the media go berserk and say he banned diversity, training he banned racial sensitivity training and then you saw the Educators saying well we'll just keep doing it, under different words or we'll just keep doing it and so the Southern Baptist convention is doing the, same thing it's making its way into Catholic organizations I hear from this all the time especially the more, left-leaning ones but it's in all of them it's making that what this new Cardinal um is kind of like advancing the ball, for them the the pope like don't even get me started on the Pope the pope is all in on this stuff, um it's in the Presbyterian Church I've heard from Buddhists, Religion, it's everywhere this stuff has infiltrated the religions the religions create an ideal delivery mechanism, to evangelize for this while taking away the most important cultural bulwark that, we have against adopting it since it's so hard with a pluralistic society like, the United States e pluribus unum implies pluralism it's so hard, outside of saying well we're Americans and we have this American liberal identity it's so hard to have clear, obvious uniting values but not in the church it's easy there so, if you can subvert the church Graham she understood Graham she understood a hundred years ago that if, you could subvert the church you could create basically the greatest you could you could remove the greatest impediment, while creating the greatest delivery mechanism for the ideology possible and this is what we're seeing the Southern, Baptist convention is pretending to back away from it they're not backing away from it and hopefully the leaders there, will stand up and continue to fight uh they're right at the edge they've got, they've got the people to say no this is wrong and then but but and, then they're they're just getting taken advantage of they're being too nice they're not standing up they're not, standing up and saying we've got you we're not doing this no no compromise, they're saying oh our brothers and sisters they mean well and so all the moves are being played you have people, saying oh if we're gonna get rid of critical race Theory we're out okay goodbye um you don't belong here the point we, don't want people who subvert this is something everybody needs to understand right now we don't want people who, subvert our organizations as Central players in our organizations and if you don't understand that you get to kiss, your organization goodbye whether it's a company whether it's a church whether it doesn't matter a university a school an, institution a hiking Club it doesn't matter what it is if you are going to allow people who want to subvert your, organization to be major players in your organization you are kissing your organization goodbye, okay enough on religion Graham she also understood that the family has to be, uh the family is a key producer and transmitter of culture it is a key Center where cultural values are, produced and reproduced and maintained uh where transmission of cultural values, from one generation to the next takes place where people learn their core values about their country about their, uh approach to life whether that's within religion or without, and so what do you see with BLM we're going to disrupt the nuclear family of course we are of course they are of, course because you have to disrupt the family because the family is a rock solid core of people you can always turn, to if the rest of the World Turns its back on you you should be able to turn to, your family you disrupt the family people have nowhere to go the only place left to go is the ideology frankly or, the state uh that's enforcing that ideology so he understood you have to disrupt the family and we see the attacks on the, family constantly nuclear family has to be dismantled with this is this is so common now that it it's been in almost, every major publication he understood that we have to uh, one of the pillars of culture is Media so therefore the ideology of Marxism has, to subvert infiltrate and subvert um media production well, Media, come on look at where we are all right they've got media there's luckily enough internet to where, there's alt media that's thankfully saying something different the problem is is all of the resources that the, major media have and all of the trusts that they've built up over years takes a while and they have tons of stuff and, ALT media has to compete against that and so they look kooky and in fact they will say kooky things they will get, things wrong more often because they don't have the same level of resources, they don't have the same level of uh built up experience institutional knowledge and so on but anyway, we clearly see that gramsci's plan to infiltrate and subvert media has gone, very successfully law is another co-producer of culture in gramshi's view, law has been very successfully infiltrated as well critical race Theory arose in law it arose out of critical, legal Theory which was an early attempt at this project by infusing it with race because, somewhere in the 1930s if you listen to the testimony of Bella Dodd speaking to the house on American activities, committee committee when she testified before Congress somewhere in the 1930s the Communists, realized that to infiltrate America their weakness would be race and so here you have Derek Bell Harvard Law cooking, up um critical race Theory by infusing Black Liberation race ideology in a very, Intersectionality, paranoid way into critical legal studies which aimed to show that the law, was in fact creating oppression that gets taken to the next level by, Kimberly Crenshaw his Protege studying under him she is the other person, credited with the creation of critical race Theory she's also the creator of intersectionality which she adopted, from earlier thought um the idea of intersectional sectionality is at all oppression is, linked that's what this is all about the marxists believe that all Society that's not Marxist is oppressive you can read, this again I mentioned horkheimer a minute ago in traditional critical theory you can read it there it's very, clear he's very explicit that that you know Marxism is science and that the, scientific Society is Marxist and the same thing goes for a any non-oppressive, society has to be Marxist it's very very clear what they're talking about and, you saw even in horkheimer the seeds of intersectionality he says explicitly, that you that the goal cannot be to um pick apart, um one form of Oppression or another uh it in fact, it has to be all the forms of Oppression at the same time, um I actually have the quote here uh I think no I don't have that quote sorry, um I have a few quotes from porkheimer written down with my notes here but not that one but he says explicitly that that the goal of, critical theory cannot be to critique one aspect or one branch of of problem, in society has to do all of them because they are all interlinked that was 1937., Kimberly Crenshaw writing this stuff down in 1990 in 1989 for the first time is not all that creative in fact she, kind of stole the idea from I mean the queer theorists were talking about it Judith Butler was talking about it before that for example uh Gail Rubin, was talking about it in the early 80s the combahi river Collective was talking about it in 1977 but anyway critical, race Theory what Kimberly Crenshaw was able to do was inject that line of thought, explicitly and effectively into law and it is now, the basis of jurisprudence even at the level of the Supreme Court the, um case that was decided over the summer about sexual orientation and gender, identity or not sexual orientation sorry gender identity and maybe about sexual orientation uh, relied upon an analysis that saw sex sexuality and gender as inextricably, linked together they depend on one another in a way that's generally close to intersectional, Education, Kimberly Crenshaw though deliberately injected intersectional thought into law, where it wasn't previously an intersectional thought of course is this idea that all oppressions are, interlinked everything's super complex better to tear the whole thing down all the way back to horkheimer in 37 grams, she had the same vision he knew that this is what had to happen and then the last one that I've left out is a domain of culture production is most important, it's education gramshi was a huge believer in the idea, that we needed to have a working class intellectuals that the working class had to be educated but not just educated, they had to be educated into a class Consciousness if we borrow off a horcrimer horkheimer was talking about, how traditional theory is kind of like science and philosophy and logic and you, know even psychology but then you have this critical theory that's kind of infused in everything and is basically, activism for his utopian dream and he's really clear he says even that the, simple-minded are doing traditional theory all the time in other words Common Sense they're thinking they're working things out they're using logic, they exist in reality instead of pseudo-reality but you have to teach critical theory he's implying that, critical theory is somehow higher rather than garbage which you're actually doing what he's actually admitting without I, think realizing is that you have to indoctrinate people into critical theory and Graham she understood that this, needed to be done in Education it needed to be done in working class education in particular and so you have a direct line, from gramshi into Brazil Apollo Ferrari in the 1960s writing the pedagogy of the, oppressed and uh basically wrecking the Brazilian education system which still, hasn't recovered as a result and then um gramsley getting translated into, English in 1970 and getting picked up by education activists like Michael Apple eventually Henry Drew Ira Shore and, later Joe kinchelo some of these critical pedagogy guys that picked all, this crap up and their idea was that you had to use education to educate a first, earlier class Consciousness then later a critical Consciousness, um critical Consciousness would have been the way of Prairie phrased it so and then that's become the, Critical Consciousness, main kind of thing the modern word for critical Consciousness modern slang term is woke, being woke means you have a critical Consciousness critical Consciousness is the cultural Marxist, reinvention of the idea of class Consciousness which is exactly the thing Marx was talking about and so they, understood that you had to educate the working class in other words you had to indoctrinate and reprogram in cult, fashion the working class to create what they called work what grams she referred to as working class intellectuals, so that they could express the proletarian view of Oppression from, within in an organic fashion this is ultimately the basis for the Long March through the institutions and the main, institution of relevance is education the whole point of their intrusion into, education was going to be the need for Consciousness raising of course the feminists were also deeply tied up with, Marxist thought all the way from the beginning they weren't all marxists of course but many of them were so Marxist, thought is always infiltrated this and you've seen feminist Consciousness or Consciousness raising being a major, project with them as well that's the idea of, of grams she's belief that there needs to be a kind of so-called working-class, intellectual you know with a working class intellectual has class Consciousness or critical Consciousness, and then is teaching that critical Consciousness he's been awakened to the nature of his own oppression as somebody, that's in the working class or later oppressed group as it came to be known I would say by the way just as an aside, that original Marxism was about about economics obviously he had the, working class versus the proletariat working class versus the bourgeoisie capitalists and was just all economic, class so you're caring about a class Consciousness then later we had a critical Consciousness that was arising and that was really this cultural, Marxism I mean gramshi is the birthplace of cultural Marxism what he's describing is applying Marx's conflict theory and, other aspects of Marx's analysis and even the hegelian's form that Marx based, his thought on the young Hig alien form uh to these aspects of culture but you, Pop Culture, hear what he's talking about you don't hear race you don't hear sex you don't hear sexuality you don't hear gender, you don't hear that stuff you hear religion family education media Law High, culture later low culture here Theodore dorno talking a lot about high culture low culture and then mid or pop culture, and the belief that adorno had deriving from these same lines of thought was that the mid culture or pop culture and, the postmodernists believe this too we're stealing away that that resentment underneath the the anger in the working, class and keeping them satisfied and so that they had to be that basically pop culture had to be, subverted to make people mad and to hate Society rather than to have them be entertained, um sort of gross when you realize what they were doing okay so, Teacher Education, um there's a lot there but this is basically the idea that Graham she had, as a education is the main place where this is going to happen so you have to literally the most influential and the, most damaging aspects of this have taken place first in our colleges of teacher, education than our universities than our K-12 schools and at this point you see, that all of those are basically captured and all of those have to be taken back uh basically as quickly as possible by, saying that no teaching a critical Consciousness that's your cultural Marxist I didn't finish that, thought I apologize critical Consciousness is not what we need to be doing we need to be teaching people as, if we go back to horkheimer's separation traditional theory we need to teach them how to be competent we need to teach, them how to think clearly we need to teach them how not to hate their society and hate everything about it so that we, can usher in some bogus Utopia that exists only in pseudo-reality Utopia literally means nowhere if you go to the, Greek roots but rather to understand the understand things for real and to do real work, around them so we need traditional theory it's not critical theorists so just to back up and finish the thought, you had Marx was pure economics and so he had class Consciousness gram, she is your cultural Marxist and they had this idea of um, of critical Consciousness and now we have this woke thing and it's all based on identity politics identity politics, by the way isn't what happened in the 1960s in the Civil Rights Movement the term identity politics was coined by, that same combahi river Collective I just mentioned which was Radical lesbian black feminists, I'm not kidding who got together they were either the black Liberty they were angry black lesbian women who got who, were in The Black liberationism which is this whole thing this is what this is liberationism, is is in essence what the the cultural Marxism is about Liberation from all, forms of Oppression I mean horkheimer uses the word explicitly in the essay I was talking about, in the exact context where all the oppressions are linked so I refer to this identity politics came from there, that term was coined in 1977 by that Collective and I refer to what's been happening since the 1960s when the, infused identity which has increased and became identity politics in this critical style when you hear the words, identity politics it is not Civil Rights Movement it is critical identity politics this is identity Marxism so, we've gone from Marxism which would be economic Marxism to cultural Marxism which criticized, elements of high and low and medium culture to Identity Marxism where they, are twisting the knife in Western societies on their weakest point which is matters of personal identity, Han Privilege, and it's it's it's been very effective they did the same thing by the way if you don't know they did the same thing, in China before Mao's cultural revolution in the decades leading up to that everything that you know about white privilege they, had a parallel concept of Han privilege Han being the dominant race of China everything you know about white, supremacy is the way the woke say it the critical theory say it they talked about Han Supremacy okay the same freaking, concept say the same ideas even a fragility the whole thing was all played out in the 20s and 30s uh going into the, 40s in China to in the hegelian turns alphaben their culture to break down, their culture in gramshi's uh vision of cultural Marxism, Cultural Marxism in China, the four olds in China were what had to be done away with old what was it old values old ideas old Customs old ways of, thinking something like that the four old Sergio and so they had to get rid of those they had to break those down that, was the cultural Marxism that's what happened in China that's what's been happening in the United, States since the 1960s as we've transitioned into this identity Marxism because clearly it works and clearly, people who don't want to be racist who don't want to be bigots are low on the defenses against it which is such crap, because we're the people who actually are in the moral High ground and they they've crooked up this this bogus, upside down world where we've sacrificed all of our moral Authority a moral High Ground to them okay so that's just to kind of give you, a picture though to so to summarize we've got so far we've got Graham she has this idea that the reason Marxist, revolutions aren't happening is because of this thing he referred to as cultural, hegemony culture hegemony means that the culture itself has a kind of power that that if you will protects it's like a, force field that protects uh from Marxist revolutions from kind of their perspective or that kind of sets the, ways it's like what do people aspire to be what do they value and it creates a kind of power there, um he believed that they're key pillars that have to be infiltrated to undermine, cultural hegemony our religion and the church family education media and law he, believed that what you have to do is infiltrate these and create a counter hegemony in other words what I've called, a pseudo-reality a pseudo-real way of thinking that's enforced by a bogus, logic I call it paralogic following I didn't make that up that's following uh, John Francois leotard and and the postmodern condition where you call it purology, um that uses a paramoral framework in other words it uses the the liberationist, Marxist liberationist framework an alternative view of society and so you're going to build this counter, hegemony within the cultural institutions and this capture the sites of cultural production that's the Long, March to the institutions as it later got called um worked very successfully for Mal is working in the United States right now, if we're not going to do something about it he thought that the key of among all of these besides maybe law would be, education education is the most powerful site you see Mao created as red guard with the students, the road map is all here grams she's an important figure and the point is to indoctrinate and, reprogram people who are in oppressed groups whether that's so-called oppressed groups whether it's a, proletariat whether that's racial minorities whether whatever it is and Stoke their grievances it is the politics of grievance the same politics, of grievance that Hitler stoked up just in a different way you get that into your head that's it's, I know that Hitler and the the marxists were not simpatico they were not buddies I know it's the same politics of, grievance however it's the same he was Awakening a German Aryan consciousness, they are waking up a whether it's a class Consciousness or an oppressed Consciousness or a woke critical, Consciousness and you're going to do that through education is a key thing another uh key idea that that Graham she, saw then as this counter hegemony he understood that there that there's kind of Two, Worlds within Society he said that they're fuzzy they overlap it's complicated it's not just you know oh, here are the political people and here are the Civil people but he broke the world basically into the state or the, um political society and then into the Civil Society and his view was that the, state uses force and the second it's challenged and it'll maybe make arguments or persuasion or coercion and, the second is challenge the fist will come out which is funny given that whose symbol is the fist right um and then, that the Civil Society is the consenting society that has to do consent, um what he believed and this is why this is important is that he believed that the, political Society is basically too difficult to assail when the cultural Society supports it or the Civil Society, supports it through culture so you have to wage political Warfare by cultural means to undermine, the cultural hegemony and Civil Society first and then you can attack the political Society either in a soft coup, or if that doesn't work in a forceful Revolution the goal he had was that you want to, create a regulated Society that as Marx dictated once you that's a, socialism basically a regulated Society the socialism and I'm not using regulation in the sense like oh well we, don't want too much smoke going in there out of our Smoke Stacks or poisoning the rivers a completely state-controlled, regulated Society a command economy really um, and Marx's hypothesis was that that will eventually once it lasts long enough become redundant people will realize, they don't actually need the state to manage their Affairs anymore and ta-da we get to our communist Utopia located at nowhere and of course, that regulated Society part run by the the party the leninist style party is, what's going to walk everybody into the blender when it doesn't work because it really only serves the needs of a small percentage of the population at the, expense of everybody else and violates both economic and human law so it it's, not going to work out but this is how he saw things it's very important to realize Graham she's the idea that there, was this two-stage Revolution where stage one is its uh political Warfare the Chinese are waging political Warfare, against us right now tapping into the political Warfare that we're waging on ourselves from within, why do you think they are tweeting things like the United States needs to get its racism problem under control, they know what they're doing so political Warfare first which is ultra ultimately culture War it's the fact, that we've been embroiled in a culture War for a long time which I would actually say has been a second Civil War for at least five, years but particularly it's come to a head this year we may be actually in a cultural World, War more or less because we have foreign actors um it's taking place all over the place, first of all on the same Battlegrounds and we have foreign actors agitating along these lines this was basically, stage one of two of of gramshi's vision for how communist parties remember he, became a leninist communist parties could seize and gain control if you want to know what's going on in the world, right now today I've said this before I'll say it again Lenin was leninism 1.0 Stalin was, leninism 2.0 Mao was leninism 3.0 woke his leninism 4.0 gram she is the road, map to how that works we don't have to get too much more deep, Gramsci and Wokeness, into a lot of grams she's thought Graham Street was a historicist which basically, means that he followed hegel's idea of the dialectic of History which got, translated in the early marks into dialectical materialism which is to say, that history is going to March along a line of kind of progress although, gramshi was a very strict or an absolute as I think the word the phrasing is historicist, and what that ultimately meant is that he believed that everything is located within its own historical context, um as a progressive kind of person heading toward a Marxist Utopia he would of, course seen the dialectic of history and his belief was that that following marks was that we had to have, the the whole project was a project of what's called Praxis Praxis is the, fusion of theory and activism it kind of as a shorthand way to explain what that means what that means in other words is, what uh horkheimer's talking about when he outlines what critical theory is it is it's something that has kind of the, Utopia at the end vision and there's a there's your theory that's going to then, criticize Society for not living up to that Utopia and it's going to pick at every means it can to do it, like following gramshi and the the Frankfurt School critical theorists we're going to pick a culture following the people after the war starting with, marcusa but adding in many of these other characters um we're going to do it according to Identity, which got much worse in the 80s and 90s as the woke movement took took flight we, called applied post-modernism and cynical theories uh which I wrote with Helen pluckrose, so gramshi's view was very anti-idealist, to the point of being relativistic that each period in history is kind of its, own thing so you can see how this kind of uh precedes the postmodern view although, I don't know quite how much influence yet Graham she had on on say the the structuralists like uh Altus there, um who was Foucault's PhD advisor uh and the kind of the birth of, post-structuralism and what became post-modernism you can also if for those who know within the the critical theory, School of Frankfurt School it also set up adorno's negative dialectic so in other words gramshi was stricter than, Hegel Hegel believed in his dialectic work that we were going to have a concept A Thesis if you will followed by, a it's antithesis but I think that German Turner's alphabung for that, um which is not quite the same as negating it means to negate and to keep, at the same time or to kind of cancel but maintain it's it's a very bizarre, German word so the idea would be that you're going to say somebody's Wrong by, saying that they weren't complete enough and then in the other end of that process you have a synthesis that that, becomes something bigger so you take the original statement you say no not quite and then you come to something bigger, and better that's basically hegel's dialectic Marx believe that applied to society, in the the kind of progress of history and gramshi, um wasn't as idealistic as as these guys especially as idealistic as Kant would have been or even as idealistic as Hegel, would have been but he believed that that what I mean by that is that he believed that the Praxis taking action, doing this becoming activists doing cultural revolution is what actually, makes it work if you don't make it work it won't work and it's also why he is a leninist where you have to have a party, that's going to Usher it in but it sets up anyways negative dialectic, you know adorno's negative dialectic drops off the synthesis part there's apparently no summary that's neat for, what adorno meant by his negative dialectic but in short since there's not one I'll give you one, uh it means that we're going to have our thesis and we're going to have our our statement that that keeps it but tears, it apart at the same time our our antithesis and then we're going to leave it at particulars we're not going to try, to synthesize into something bigger and more complete so it's a it's a more tearing down process that adorno was, laying out so you can kind of see again lots of parallels to post-modernism so you can see how these things we're going, to be able to be fused later um again same kind of thing he was against, Marx's idea that there was this inevitability uh the later Marx writing especially in Dallas copy tell it, there's this inevitability of History to produce capitalism evolving into socialism and socialism evolving into communism uh and, therefore favored active Revolution again this is a two-stage thing he he, criticized Marx as having kind of a naive economism is what I think what he, called it um but this two-stage first cultural then political revolution in order to uh, install a uh Marxist ultimately uh Utopia nor path, toward Utopia but he was a leninist so you can see where where it's really going so, therefore he was against reform he was against incrementalism he thought that those things maintained too much of the status quo they don't break hegemony and, said you have to dissolve and subvert those things and thus replace them with the new thing in in kind of revolution, and like I said kind of just to wrap up with graham Street's views he was actually anti-objective because of his, strict historicism his absolute view that everything is contingent upon the historical conditions in which it occurs, there is no technically objective location or truth everything is just a historical contingency this of course, was a key idea within Foucault a key idea within the postmodern thought, um he got accused of being a relativist for it and denied that but he said that, there's absolutely no objective Universe outside of human history the same line of same idea is reflected in horkheimer, and critical in his his outline of critical theory and traditional and critical theory is the name of the essay in 1937, um more or less uh like this is a this is one of the, quotes I did write down from horkheimer Modern theoreticians of knowledge do not deny the importance of historical, circumstance so again he's saying that all knowledge is is rooted in historical circumstance, even if among the most influential non-scientific factors they assign more, importance to genius and accident than to social conditions so you can hear in horkheimer that the underlying social, conditions in other words some kind of marxist analysis is what really Bears on, how we understand what is and is not true what constitutes knowledge and what, does not constitute knowledge um um, he says the same this is horkheimer on a gram sheet here but another one the self-knowledge of of present day man, is not a mathematical knowledge of nature which claims to be the Eternal logos but a critical theory of society, as it is a theory dominated at every turn by a concern for reasonable, conditions of life in those reasonable conditions of Life Of course are going to be defined by Marxist theory that, actually is the first mention of critical theory horkheimer gives um so, in that essay so it is that a critical theory is one that is interested in uh, making sure that that to quote it is a theory dominated at every turn, by a concern for reasonable conditions of life in other words we're no longer going to be concerned with what's true, we're going to be concerned with what creates reasonable conditions of life according to somebody who literally says, that it has to be gauged against the Utopia as its North Star and that Utopia is going to be Marxist, so this is the this is when when I say that there's this no objectivity, view within gram sheet you hear it again in horkheimer it's explicit even in this stupid two plus, two equals five they even all summer it's reverberating again now explicitly, saying that the point of arguing that two plus two equals five which is ludicrous it's not true in any universe, is to dismantle the idea of objective truth okay so all the way back through, all the way back you see this in gramshi everything's historically contingent you see it in horchheimer uh 10 years later, it's these These are the ideas the objectivity is bogus everything's historically contingent and the view is, the religion is is at the end of History we achieve the Marxist Utopia that's the end of History there's no more progress, to history at that point because we've achieved the harmonious utopian State we've created God's Kingdom on Earth the, Millennium is fulfilled that's what this is this is actually a, religion and gramshi was one of its greatest theologians and he's been very effective and so he's a very important, character to understand Antonio gramsci again Italian Marxist who was jailed by the fascists, in 1926 wrote very important series of books called this prison notebooks it's, actually pretty long he wrote those Wiley he was in prison they tried to silence him by sending him, to prison and that totally backfired translated into English in 1970, apparently translated into Portuguese or something somewhat earlier I don't know what language Ferrari wrote it in or, read it in but at any rate became the basis for all of our critical education, theory that dominates all of the schools in the west now uh by the early 1980s this is the Long, March to the institutions laid out it's the same one that Mal used and again to quote gramshi maybe his, most famous quote socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity that, was his View and this is the character upon which so much of the left's world, has turned he is the one who in some sense after the revolutions the attempted, revolutions save the Russian one failed this is the man who reinvigorated, that socialist religion who brought it back from the edge of, death by understanding and creating cultural Marxism, and using cultural Marxism to lay the groundwork that allowed for the success, of as I've called it leninism 3.0 which was executed by Mao Zedong in China and, londonism 4.0 which is being foisted upon the rest of the world especially, the West right now under the brand name woke, so lots to look into lots to think about lots to understand but this has been in, the works for a while this is the thing we're up against [Music], , 

[The Imprisoned Philosopher] folks today we are going to study Antonio gramsci and the way we're going, to manage our examination of gramshi is that as, you know I gave you one reading but I broke it up into two parts so we'll be looking at the first part which is, approximately 32 pages in which his focus is uh his criticism of economism, what we call economism but in the process of criticizing economism you see, that he develops many many interesting new and different ideas about hegemony, about political and Civil Society about the state about the relationship between, the economic base and the superstructure and so on and all of those ideas are very very pertinent although they all, emerge out of the singular strand of criticizing economism um I hope that most of you have done the, reading can you can we just do a quick show of hands to see who has attempted the reading, okay that's wonderful and how many people felt comfortable with it uh uh you know that it was it was okay in, terms of the difficulty level I managed to get maybe 60 70 percent of it, okay found the reading too difficult stopped reading because it was too, difficult didn't read because it was too difficult okay didn't read it at all, okay so I completely empathize with those who were are unable to, sort of extract from the reading what's going on because well there's two major reasons for that, the first is that gramshi is responding to various people in his own time frame, who are writing about Marxism writing on behalf of Marxism or writing against, Marxism and so in responding to them he's more or less assuming that you know the, people or at least know the arguments that those people have made and that you're familiar with both Marxism as, well as the arguments with which he's dealing so it's kind of again once again a situation where you're entering into a, debate in the middle of the debate rather than being introduced to all the terms that's the first major difficulty, the second major difficulty is that these writings were writings that gramshi wrote while he was in prison and, so the access that he had to various books and sources of information were, naturally limited although he did have access to some but it was not by his choice what he had, access to moreover he had to write things in a way that sometimes he was, using terms deliberately he was using code names or rather he was changing the, terms he could have written it much more simply for example he could have just said the philosophy of Marxism says XYZ, but you'll notice or Marxism says XYZ but you notice he doesn't use that term he uses the term the philosophy of, Praxis leaving many of us thinking what is that and how is that different from Marxism and how does that relate to, everything and so on and he uses a number of terms in this particular way for example there are a number of, passages where he writes about Nations fighting in military Wars whereas you, can very clearly see that what he really means is class is fighting in them the reason why he can't write classes is, because everything is right he's writing is going to be read by the prison authorities so he has to somewhat change, the meaning here and there in order for it to pass the sensors and you really have to be sort of more or less aware, what he's getting at in order to really understand what he's talking about so for these two reasons number one the, fact that he's jumping into the middle of the debate sorry you're jumping into the middle of a debate that you're not, familiar with you need a prior knowledge of Marxism and the debates around it and for the, reason that he's trying to avoid the prison sensor otherwise the Pres the sensor of the prison will say sorry but, we're confiscating these writings we're not going to allow them to be given to your family or your friends or comrades, or whatnot so he's trying to avoid that and thirdly of course he's writing mostly out of memory what a phenomenal, memory he had really to be so productive in prison is quite phenomenal interestingly fairs Ahmed fares uh the, great Pakistani poet and critic of the establishment and left-wing Progressive, figure the iconic left-wing Progressive figure of Pakistan also wrote most of, his most famous poems while being in prison I think the reason why people get so productive sometimes in prison is, that they get an awful amount of time they have nothing at all to do with uh, because there's you know I mean there's really nothing you can do while you're sitting there so some people like to you, know sort of hit the gym and work out and become huge and other people like to read and write and so on and write, phenomenal things another great example of someone who really developed intellectually while being in prison is, Malcolm X who went into prison for one reason and came out of prison a, completely reformed and changed person ready and willing to fight for the rights of the African-American community, so but this is a particularly brutal prison and it was particularly brutal for gramshi because this is a prison, under Italian fascism and they of course had no love lost for for Antonio gramsci, and it was very difficult for gramshi as well because he had very developed he already had and further developed very, very serious health problems while in prison and died at a very young age and, so you can imagine that this is this was you know no walk in the park so to speak, so gramshi gets his name from a town in eastern Albania which is called grams, and that's just changed into its Italian sort of name gramshi he wasn't born in, in Albania but it's probably his grandparents or his great-grandparents were born there and they migrated to, Italy but they kept the the surname of the village it's a bit like what happens in Pakistan that many of us have uh if, you're not so Urban as as you people are many of us will have surnames that belong to our our Villages Etc you know, we'll have I don't know Faisal lalpuri or something you know and so on so, that's the name that the family retained he was uh he grew up he was born and he grew up in this, um in Sardina which is uh as you can see in Ireland which is part of Italy his, father was in 1898 convicted of corruption probably there was a PTI, government at the time who knows and uh and he was then uh imprisoned and as a, consequence of the imprisonment of his father uh the family was became, completely destitute not that they were very well off before but now they became very very poor in fact they became so, poor that gramsi had to stop his schooling and said and had to do work in order to make I had to do odd jobs to, make ends meet um finally his father was released in 1904 and gram she could then thereafter, continuous schooling and so on so forth gramshi suffered from child from from very early on from his childhood with, very very severe health problems uh he had a terrible malformation of the spine which stunted his growth and meant that, he was not even five feet tall he was shorter than five feet tall and he had he was hunchbacked because of that, malformation of the spine and for the longest time the gramshi family believed that his caretaker had accidentally, dropped him when he was a kid and that's why his spine something wrong happened to his spine but subsequent research has, sort of proven that he had a disease which caused that malformation to occur that's gramsi at the age of 15. uh very, Italian looking boy as you can see that's his father and that's his mother with his sister just thought I'd share, those photographs with you there aren't a lot of photographs of Antonio gramci um actually there's only a couple and I, try to make do with the ones that were available I went to a website called uh the international gramshi society which, had these very rare photographs which are not often shared um or not often public I mean I'm, they're not secret or anything um so yeah I think one of the reasons is that he spent most of his adult life, Behind Bars and obviously people were not really he was there was not going to be a photographer to go there and have a, look at him in 1911 when gramshi was he was a brilliant student and in 1911 he managed, to win a scholarship to this amazing University that's the University of Turin and which is of course where he, made his name as a leftist and so on so forth I don't know if you can see this very clearly because of the light but, you know you can look at the architecture it's absolutely magnificent looks like a palace and the and the lawn, over here is perfectly manicured with a design on it which of course needs a lot, of work to do something of that sort so a highly you know sort of an elite University of a very you know sort of, good University where he you know he really excelled in philosophy and, other things and I think he really came into his own in 1913 soon after University, he joined the Italian Socialist Party now just a note here that this is uh the, Italian Socialist Party was already a pretty strong party and Italy already had its own working-class tradition and, so on and so the Italian Socialist Party at this particular stage isn't really as such connected to Lenin and so on so, forth It's its own very much its own party by 1916 he you know showed himself, to be a very good writer he was writing on working-class issues on their struggles in Turin and so on and so in, his own town he became the co-editor of Avante which means forward of the, Socialist the the party's official newspaper these newspapers are quite, significant in Europe but in also in India and other parts of Asia where the newspapers of the Social, Democratic party or the Socialist Party or the Communist Party enjoy wide circulation and I read more or less like, Jung and Nevada more or less like daily papers in Pakistan party newspapers tend, to be extremely tiny 500 a thousand circulation but in other parts of the, world party newspapers can be very very major newspapers for example in the United Kingdom one of the newspapers, that you can pick up from the newsstand is called the morning star and that's actually the newspaper of the Communist, Party of Britain similarly humanity is a the paper of the humanity is the paper of, the Communists used to be the paper of the Communist Party of France and so on so, um by 1919 he had set up his own weekly newspaper which was called the New Order, the Italian Socialist Party was commit was you know a very diverse sort of group of people so they were all, socialists in one way or another but it was a it was relatively speaking quite uh it had still had a very diverse uh, sort of ideological spread and because of that diversity it also you know there was also a lot of factional infighting, Etc and gramsi thought that it wasn't a very effective party and by 1919 of course the Bolshevik, Revolution has occurred which is in 1917 in Russia the Russian Revolution and, gramshi is very much attracted to Lenin's style of leadership uh his PO, his party his understanding of how to do politics and so on so forth and what gramci wants to do is to create a, Marxist leninist party in the context of Italy and the newspaper that he takes out this new weekly newspaper the New, Order is more or less dedicated to this that particular function that we are going to popularize Lenin's ideas and, create in Italy a party like the Bolshevik party in Russia, um in 19 from between 1919 and 1920 Turin where gramshi is an activist and, working and organizing workers experiences big Mass working class strikes really really huge strikes but, sadly by 1920 they are defeated by the way across Europe at that time from 1917 18 1990 up to 1920 there are, strikes and protests and revolutionary movements in almost every part of Europe Germany Australian Empire everywhere, these strikes have a very deep impact on gramshi he observes them very closely he's working with them very closely, observes the workers very closely he observes how they organize and he's very much influenced not just by the, literature that he's reading coming in from Russia but very much by his experiences they're amongst working, people he himself is a belongs to you know the working class as a whole, um by January 1921 gramshi com uh is able to gather enough support together, with another leader called bordiga together they're able to gather enough support to say we don't want to stay, with the Italian Socialist Party we are going to create a new party which is called the Italian Communist party which, actually goes on for towards you know sort of enormous success dogliati is the, big leader of the Italian was the big leader of the Italian communist movement interestingly togliati was also a, student at the University of Turin when gram she was a student there there were students together there okay, soon after the formation of the Italian Communist Party, um it was it followed there was a period of repression against the party in 1926, the fascist government enacted emergency laws that's Mussolini's government, on the pretext that there was an attempt an alleged attempt on Mussolini's life, and so after that the police had already arrested Bodega but now had also, arrested Antonio gramshi despite the fact that he ought to have had parliamentary immunity at his trial, gramshi's prosecutor stated for 20 years we must stop this brain from functioning, and he received a 20-year sentence where he was incarcerated and that's a, one of the shots that we have of him while he was imprisoned after about 11 years in prison his health had, deteriorated enormously his teeth had fallen out his digestive system had collapsed he couldn't eat solid foods, and he had convulsions when he vomited blood he suffered headache so violent that he beat his head against the walls, of his cell so you know he was really in a very bad state in prison there was in, fact an international campaign for his release from Cambridge University from professors at Cambridge University, he was due to be released due to be released on April 21st 1937 but he had, become so ill by that time that he couldn't really be moved he had a number of sort of diseases many of which are so, difficult that I can't even pronounce them but artery arteriosclerosis pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure vagina gout acute gastric disorders good God he was in a, terrible State and when he his release date was 21st April by 27 April 1937 he, passed away only at the age of 46. when I think about that it depresses me because that means I only have two more, years to go if I was gramshi and so his ashes are buried here that's, his uh that's his tomb Etc uh but in this period and despite all this ill health, he managed to write 30 notebooks over 3000 pages on history on politics and on, philosophy and so on So You know despite all these difficulties he was quite prolific in his intellectual output had, he lived longer you know we could have expected more great things from him, his contribution to uh the intellectual Heritage that of humanity includes his, ideas about cultural hegemony which we discussed in nearly all social science courses, um as a means of legitimize the capitalist State the idea of organic intellectuals what are organic, intellectuals versus technocratic intellectuals his distinction between political society and Civil Society what, are the what what is that distinction how do we understand it uh his critique of historicism and economic determinism, which is I think one of the key elements in his entire thing because a lot of others a lot of his other Concepts like, the distinction between political and Civil Society cultural hegemony organic intellectuals really flow out of his, this main concern of uh of how do we understand economic determinism and, historicism and so on I'll explain these terms in just a bit what do I mean by economic determinism and historicism and, finally his critique of pre-marxist materialism and there are loads of other things as, well I mean on Italian history on world history and so on but these are just some of the main very very big, influences that people widely acknowledge so where do we begin so that was his, life in a nutshell very very briefly Where Do We Begin how do we begin to understand, gramsi's actual thought in order to understand gramshi we've got to First understand Karl Marx, and in order to understand Karl Marx we have to be on the correct slide right so now to understand, gramsi we've got to understand how Marx understood history and his criticism of, capitalist Society and of course one can you know Marx was a, prolific writer the collected works of Marx and Engels are 52 volumes and you, can go all over the place you know looking at nuances and so on so forth but the passage that is perhaps most, widely quoted is this one in front of you in which he sort of very quickly, sums up this is the preface to uh what is it the critique of political economy, Etc in which he very quickly tries to sum up in a few sentences the way that, he wants us to understand history or examine history and inevitably because it's a preface and because it's a very, very brief statement it runs the risk of being misunderstood misinterpreted or you know sort of uh there is potential, for distorting how Marx understood things if you just read one passage as there is a similar potential in Reading, any passage outside of the larger context in which it is being written but, nonetheless this is one of the most widely cited passages out of Marx's work and very very influential for that, reason so let's read through this passage try and understand what he's saying so he says in the social production, I have a red dot in the social production of their existence men and by, men here he means human beings in German they often you know sort of they write men all the time whether they mean human, beings am I right about that it's non-gendered is it not is it non-gendered, male yes thank you I don't know any German but I know that and a few other, things um so humans inevitably enter into definite relations which are independent, of their will so let's stop there just for a second to produce and reproduce life we cannot, produce and reproduce life individually we have to enter into social relations, right we have to enter into relations with each other as uh to to have children obviously we have to enter into, sexual relations to uh to produce the necessities of life food clothing, shelter we have to work together at some level cooperate with each other at some level to protect ourselves against, animals that may try and hurt us and so on so forth we have to work together, so what what does he mean that they're independent of our will what he means by that is that these relations that we, form with each other are not relations that we can merely pick and choose but they are in, accordance with the circumstances in which we exist if we are living in the jungle we'll have to evolve certain kind, of relations if we're living in the mountains if we're living in the whatever our material conditions are, those will determine what kind of relations we have to we can create namely the relations of production, appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of, production so what are these relations these are relations of production and reproduction and they have to be appropriate to the, level of development of their material forces of production so what is material, forces of production mean it means our ability to produce what stage are we at, in terms of our what kind of relationship do we have with nature to what extent are we able to manipulate, nature such that we are able to benefit from it though that will determine what, sort of relations we also have with each other in other words the stage of our, development of economic uh our economic technology our ability to produce in, turn the tools we use the kind of tools we have created in turn also determine, how you and I are going to what sort of social relations you and I are going to have with each other in in that process, of our work and production so in an advanced Society with a high, degree of Technology you will have relations that may be very different for example if you have a society where you, could have meetings that are online or you could wear a little workout, what is that called virtual mask and have a meeting with somebody sitting in, Tokyo right and it would seem like you're sitting in the same boardroom right as happens in Sci-Fi movies, Etc well then that would mean that you could have a boardroom meeting without traveling from one part of the world to, the other part of the world and that would mean of course certain things about what sort of relations you would have these days to give you another, example which is may be more pertinent to or you can relate to it much better these days you have thousands of friends, on Facebook and on social media and you know and you are impacted by them, and of course you can read articles about how they are not really friends they're just you know sort of social, media friends and real friends are the ones that you actually get to hang out with and spend time with and so on and I, I think there's something I think that argument is not incorrect because there is something to real one-on-one, interaction versus reading somebody's comment on a screen but at the same time it has to be said that those comments on, the screen have a huge impact on your on your uh on your uh image of yourself on, your estimation of yourself on your self-esteem you get a bad comment in the morning you know somebody says you know, uh something like this is a dumb thing that you shared and you don't know your, satra from your surface so whatever they say you know you don't know anything blah blah blah, and you're going to be a bit depressed throughout the day because those are real people they are not robots and, they're writing to real people and they do have a psychological impact that's why people can be Cyber Bullied that's, why people can fall in love even on the over the over social media or chase each other and so on so forth so, for that reason while social media cannot certainly substitute for real relationships, one-on-one real relationships it is a relationship of some sort a different one from the one that you have sitting, in front of each other you could be in contact with somebody who's sitting in Canada on a daily basis and not be in, touch with somebody who is your roommate you know depending on how much time you spend on the internet versus talking to, your roommate so what I'm trying to say is technology changes the way we can talk, to each other we can relate to each other who we can relate to at any given point in time you know how how many, people we can relate to and so on so forth it does change that and I'm only talking about communication here Marx is, talking about the process through which we come together and work together and, that can be changed by the kinds of tools available to us so he says the totality of these relations of, production that is the way in which we come together in order to produce all of them put together totality means if you, take all of those relations in any given Society you put them all together that constitutes the economic structure of, society the real foundation on which arises a legal and political, superstructure so before we go into the superstructure let's just look at that so if you put together all the, relationships that you have let's look at some of the relationships that that are immediately observable around you, first of all there's the relationship that you and I or you have with your professors then there's a relationship, that you have with the staff of of uh or with each other then you have a relationship with the staff that works, here somebody of course does the cooking and you go and eat in PDC somebody does, the cleaning the gardening somebody guards there are people who guard the your University and so on so forth and, we even though we may not say hello to them we may not might not exchange your pleasantries with them but we really, actually do have a certain relationship with them which keeps us where we are at, even if we don't want to recognize that but that is the objective reality so that he says you put all of that, together that's the economic Foundation that's the economic structure of a given society and it's on that economic, structure Mark says that all your ideas your ideology your thought processes, your culture your laws Etc your legal and political institutions they are, really reflecting or based on those economic relationships relationships, that we enter into as we produce and to these legal politicals to this, legal political superstructure and to the economic structure correspond definite forms of social Consciousness, so our ideas are correspond to our relationships and those relationships, are the real relationships that we have in the process of production who does, what work what role do they have in society in that work what benefits do they get out of society for doing that, work and so on those are very very important in determining the political institutions which in turn are very very, instrumental in determining our thought processes about institutions about work, about life about uh politics about economics so on so forth, the mode of production of material life he says conditions the general process of social political and intellectual, life so the way that you come together for work determines the way that you, come together for everything else consider that we belong to most of us, perhaps belong to the middle class to the upper middle class to the upper class Etc consider that and to no fault, of your own because that's just the way Society is structured so this is not a moralistic thing I'm not pointing a finger at you but consider that most of, our friends will be from the same class that we are from they will be from, neither from the class that's above us nor from the class that's below us the class that's below us will not we will, not befriend because well first of all we don't really have too much interaction with them aside from ordering them about, perhaps right and secondly there is a stigma attached to that right where sort, of oh my God he's hanging out with he's slumming it or whatnot Etc right I mean there is a sort of coolness to be to be, part of the the cool crowd and the cool crowd is going to be the elite of Any Given Society mostly I'm not saying, everybody thinks that way but mostly societies do think that way that the elite of those societies are considered, to be cool people good you know successful people and people want to hang out with successful people so, consider for example that our social relationships are by and large formed by, our class which in turn is formed by our position our positionality within uh you, know within the mode of production and this occurs nearly from birth this, occurs right from the beginning it occurs so naturally in any person's life that you don't even think that it occurs, for example I'll take myself as an example here I am standing in front of you wearing jeans and a a shirt Etc, speaking in relatively fluent English if not a slightly Punjabi fight English accent Etc right but all of this all of, those things are really to use slightly postmodern language symbols of, particular of a particular class status if I was born in a village my address, would be very different my friends would be very different my language would be very different my thoughts would be very different psychologists do this little, really interesting experiment where they take teenagers or really young kids and, what they do is they they put a coin in front of them there was a coin somewhere over here I thought I saw a coin can't, find it anymore anyway they put a coin in front of homeless children and uh and, in front of children who are you know sort of middle class or upper middle class and they they put a coin in front, of them then they take the coin away and then they ask them to draw the coin on a piece of paper and what they noticed was, that the children who were from poverty always drew the coin slightly larger on, average than the children who uh were from better off homes and so psychologists concluded that you know, there's a part of your brain called the reticular activating system things that you desire this you know you're walking, through a if let's say you're walking through a Superstore and this one chocolate that you really love and, there's all these chocolates on the side but suddenly your brain is programmed in such a way that bang if that chocolate, appears that you really like your mind your eye can pick up that particular chocolate from an array of chocolates, that's how you identify things very quickly that's how you identify familiar faces for example in a crowd of people, you can pick out familiar faces without necessarily looking at every individual phase just look at the crowding like oh, I know that person right how do you do that that's how the there is a there is a mechanism in the mind that allows you, in fact to do that and that works specifically with faces more than with any other object so things that you, desire your mind focuses on um and so children bought in poverty, focus on that so what am I trying to say very perception of the world is, determined you know even perception of how large something is how desirable it is how much you want it is determined by, what you have and what you don't have and what others have it plays a very big, role it's easy to dismiss it and say money means nothing to me but then if you don't have money then you discover, suddenly that if you really really don't have it that it that it deprives you of, many many things that are not necessarily material it's not just that you don't you want to have more stuff, but it deprives you of many many opportunities that can be you know can, result in you having a very low self-esteem a bad image about yourself, or will not give you the potential the ability to really reach your potential, so the mode of production life says Karl Marx determines uh sorry the more the mode the mode of production of material, life conditions the general process of Social and intellectual life it is not so he sums all of this up by saying it, is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their, Consciousness so our ideas are determined by our is determined by our, activity and one of the main forms of our activity is the activity of producing together this may seem rather, odd to you people because you are not yet engaged in the process of production given that you're all students and your, right now what we call dependence your parents pay for your food clothing shelter and you're supposed to only, study and you tell your parents yes yes I'm studying which of course you're not doing it all but the point is you're not, yet part of the economy right you're going to become part of the economy soon but as soon as you become part of the, economy it is going to you'll see it's going to take over your life it's going to be 8 hour hours of your day and after, you're done with hopefully you would have been at our job uh but if you do most likely you will and after you're, done with the eight hours of the day you will spend the next eight hours recovering from the eight hours that you, worked and then you'll spend eight hours sleeping so that's basically your life um, taking from experience yes although Lums is quite good in this regard that actually we get we professors at Lums uh, have it quite uh we have quite a bit of spare time which we're supposed to spend reading and researching and writing and, meeting with you people Etc of course we're not doing none of that you're you know you're shaking your head, we do none of that we you know play video games or I don't know what we do but you know the point is that uh, professors at the foreman Christian college for example at FC college at the, same level as myself teach not three courses a year but guess how many, seven they teach seven courses a year exactly so yeah, but you know and that's why I can do Lal band and all the other things you see if I didn't have if I was at FC College, then I really would be putting in you know like I don't know 10 hours a day and uh I wouldn't do be able to do all, the other things that's how all I'm the reason I say that is because I'm trying to show you how the work that you do, determines not just the things that you have but even also the opportunities that you have with respect to your own, time so and obviously the activity you're involved in is basically what you're, going to be thinking about if you don't have time to think about if you if you're sweeping the floors day in, day out and uh you know or you're working in a factory or you are in the, in the grind then you don't have time to think about whether the Big Bang Theory is correct or whether there is an, infinite number of big Banks where the string theory is correct whether quantum mechanics is right or whether the, general theory of relativity by Einstein is right you're not going to have the sources available to you the time to go, through what has been written on that subject to deliberate on those matters you may have the potential you may have, the intelligence you may have the ability but you will not have the opportunity and what are you going to be occupied, with in terms of your mind is going to be the things that you are occupied with in terms of your time, so what we get from this is this sort of a a metaphor of a base and a, superstructure a triangle Marks here is using an architectural sort of metaphor, so we've made a pyramid out of it where the economic the economy is the base and, the superstructure which includes art it includes family it includes culture, religion philosophy law media politics Science Education music literature all, of those things are in the superstructure the base includes excuse me everything related to the, economy the tools use the machines used the factories the land the raw materials, all this stuff and the various classes that are created in the process of production Industrial working class, managerial class so on so forth that's the base now we come to the interesting part so, this was just the background now we come to the interesting part now there is a way to understand what Marx, has written here which can be very narrow and economistic right which is, that everything that happens in the superstructure everything that happens in culture everything that happens in, family religion education politics whatever everything that's written is directly, related to some dire immediately and directly related to some economic direct, economic cause so we try to figure out if we want to know why a particular war is happening, why is America attacking Iraq or what is it doing in Iran Etc we try to find the, economic causes and those can be important but a lot of times States will go to war, even when there isn't a significant economic benefit to be gained and we, know this from history we know this from history that for example the the the the British went to war with, Afghanistan several times two three times in fact not because they thought that Afghanistan had any economic benefit for, them they thought but simply because they wanted to make sure that the Russians don't take over, Afghanistan so they made it into a sort of buffer area so they had no economic they didn't want, to they didn't necessarily want to gain anything economic out of Afghanistan but they wanted to make sure Russia doesn't get in so they went to war in those, places so you can go to war for geostrategic reasons rather than directly economic reasons and so on, so when we understand these sorts of things we cannot therefore conclude that, every action in war in politics in culture is somehow directly related to, economics if we do that we make a caricature uh we we I think we simplify, a human life way too much so so that is called economic, reductionism the idea that everything is economics self-interest governs Nations, and drives the world forward everything is about self-interest class self-interest individual self-interest, State self-interest and so on this is too simplistic and although we use this, as an assumption sometimes to teach for example rational Choice Theory and so on so forth but we also recognize that this, can be a bit overly simplistic when understanding the motivations of people after all people undertake you must have, undertaken many actions that are economically harmful for you but are beneficial in other ways for example you, may have decided you know okay you give you give your friends treats you say okay let's go out for dinner Etc you, don't care about who pays for what Etc with friends why because that's not really what you're concerned with you, the Friendship is much more important to you than you know 10 20 rupees Etc so you don't care about it at that level, and sometimes your friends with people who are actually bad for you and still, yet you're friends with them you know codependent relationships right sometimes you can be in a relationship with someone which is terrible for you, uh for both part Partners in fact for both parties in fact and yet you stick it out in that relationship despite the, fact that any rational analysis would have suggested you should get out of that relationship ASAP but you can't right you can't get out of relationships, in so easily when you are how should I put it when you are invested in those relationships it's not, so easy to say here's the calculus on net my girlfriend has benefited me this much and cost me that much so off with a, head it's not so easy right yes so gramsi is of the view that economic, determinism or reduction sorry before I get to gramsi so economic determinism or economic reductionism is the view that, all political or cultural phenomena are determined by or can be reduced to the economic structure and this is a bit, simplistic overly simplistic Marx did say for example the hand Mill produces, feudalism the steam Mill produces capitalism and it does sound very reductionist to say something of that, sort but you've got to remember that Marx is making these statements in the context of a discussion about history in, or unfolding over tens of thousands of years thousands of years and at that scale to take something that may be true, at that scale that one Society one kind of society will give one kind of economy, will give rise to a particular kind of society another kind of economy will give rise to another kind of economy may, be true at the Grand level of this Grand scale of all of history but it's not, necessarily true you arrive at the Grand scale of History Marx himself says through various accidents and you know, movements that seem to be random and so on so forth and yet you arrive he says, at this thing so gramshi wants to say that in fact when you examine politics, at the everyday level you discover that the base and superstructure don't just, have a relationship one way that the base explains everything in the superstructure but that the relationship, flows both ways the economic base is really shapes and maintains the superstructure, and in turn the superstructure is created in such a way so as to justify legitimize the economic base hence not, every change in politics is the result of Economics economic structure itself is always changing leaders sometimes, make mistakes some decisions are made because of internal necessities of an organizational kind for example a, political party may need to make certain changes etc etc but has nothing to do with the economic base it has to do with, the politics of the time so does that mean you know marxists by, the way I understand that many of you people will be like yeah what's the relevance of all this stuff about, economic base and superstructure how is it sort of you know changing anything in, our lives and so on and I can respect that but I think you've got to appreciate perhaps you've got to, appreciate K you know the understanding that all of history uh the the the idea, that all of history could be understood uh by examining how economic, contradictions had played themselves out is a very powerful idea it's a very uh, it's an idea that has played a very influential role in our times and when, you take that argument and extend it too far and you try to make everything come out of Economics then I think you know, you you take a good solid argument and you make it a bit you know you take any good solid argument make it make it a, bit too extreme then it falls on its face um so I think that's why it's very, important to be able to Define you know to what extent economic in the economy, influences are uh our social decision making political decision making our, ideas and so on but not to go to but not to go to town on it not to go so extreme on it that you know every question has, to have an economic answer and I think that's basically what um gram she's trying to explain to you, is you know how these two Realms interact so for those people who are, who are taking political economy can we have a show of hands or whose major is political economy sorry economics with, politics so this debate about the relationship between the base and the superstructure, is one of the key debates in political economy as a whole how do these two Realms the realm of the economic and the, realm of the political how do they interact with each other that's pretty much what a whole of political economy, is about it's very important for us to be able to tease that out in some way or the other, so gramshi says structure is not a hidden God here he's referring to something that croquet has written that, determines everything structure and superstructure are intimately connected interrelated and act reciprocally, structures and superstructures form a historic block that's a very important, phrase there historic block and I'd like you to please write that down if if you have your notebooks Etc, uh so a historic block is formed out of a structure and a superstructure so superstructure is not merely unimportant, appearances or an unimported to parents it forms the ideological and cultural hegemony necessary for the, legitimization of the state so so we can't just say something is ideological, so it's unimportant Marx has never implied that ideology is unimportant, angles gramshi is trying to just reinforce the fact that to say that the economy, plays a very influential role in how in our conceptions is not to say is not the, same as saying that our conceptions are unimportant in the world of politics and so on so forth not at all and I love, this phrase by gramshi where he says by highlighting the anatomy and the function of the skeleton nobody was, trying to claim that man still as woman can live without skin can live without, the skin so obviously if I'm saying that you know the ma a person stands on the, basis of their bone structure that doesn't mean that if you you can't have a human being with just bones they have, muscles and tissue and skin and everything else and that's the whole organism so to understand Society you, you should liken the economic base to the skeletal structure to the bone structure but that does not mean that, everything else is unimportant of course they interact with each other you can't move a muscle where your bone does not, allow a allow a muscle to move I can't I don't have a joint here so I can't make this thing move backwards actually when, once I fell off a tree I broke both these bones and then my arm was like this for a while which was not fun it, hurt a lot um but given intact bones it's not, possible right so obviously people are exaggerating the argument so the this exaggeration has occurred both by those, who oppose Marxism and even by those who claim to be marxists themselves this happened on both sides of the spectrum, so take for example Jordan Peterson whose favorite hobby horse is to is you, know trying to is always constantly attacking feminists but now he's developed from there to attacking the, left as a whole so the argument that the debate that he had with the uh the crazy fellow, yes uh Zizek who can't stop sniffling all the time, in that debate you must recall Jordan Peterson made it out to seem like Marx is saying that economics determines, everything right so he's pushing marks into economic reductionism so that's really what gramshi is saying that, that's a caricature of what Marxism superstructures are an operational, reality that's an error sorry the it says gramshi that's those are his words superstructures are objective and an, operative in reality Mark spoke about the solidity of popular beliefs and when, this way of concerning and when this way of conceiving things has the force of popular belief this is another phrase, for Marx so when a particular way of thinking about things becomes common, sense that becomes the politics of Common Sense and that is a material real, force that you have to contend with when you enter politics to change society, right did you have a question okay in other words popular conviction has the same energy as a material Force says, Antonio gramsci the philosophy of Praxis here again he means Marxism itself is a, superstructure says gramshi it is the expression of those subaltern classes who want to educate themselves in the, act of government and who have an interest in knowing all truths to give you an example, is Martin Luther King's Junior's famous speech I Have a Dream that one day this, nation will rise up live out the true meaning of its Creed we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men, are created equal has no impact on the economy you can't say it's derived from the economy but it animates an entire uh, social many social movements in fact that are working for civil Democratic, equality and the fact that he can pose it in this particular way is very, significant for example he could have just said we want equality for blacks and we want equality for women and we, want equality for all people right people have been making that speech for ages has had no impact but when he says, it in this way I have a dream why does it resonate with the American public because the American public has been, brought up on the idea of the American dream and so when he relates his dream to the, American dream that's very that's a very powerful articulation of how the, American dream needs to be changed or what the real American Dream ought to have been and so on so forth you see the, point here that's why he's powerful that's why he's effective is because he can do that to give you another example, when he says, now that's taken from that's every well you don't know it but, in the old days where where moms and dads didn't have TVs or radios what did they do they sat around the dinner table, and they used to read to each other I know because my grandparents used to do that all the time they used to sit down, at the dinner table and then they would start you know throwing garlic phrases at each other and like ball phrases at, each other and stuff and I was there listening to I don't know you know uh DJ, Jazzy Jeff and the French Prince or something totally out of it and now I can appreciate that that how well keyed, in they were with that so when fast takes a misra from ghale and turns it, around into something different says, when he weaves that into the same meter and he uses that you know he's doing something in and he does that with all, his poems right I mean he's taking the style of Ghazal poetry which was all about oh my God lost my loved one and, isn't life terrible and horrible and miserable let's face it all of Ghazal poetry is, about music okay but he doesn't okay all of ghale okay, he's so miserable come on he's like lemon lamenting The Lost World of moral, greatness and you know his aristocratic uh decadences all constantly he is isn't, he okay thank you is, miserable but he's amazing just because somebody is miserable doesn't mean they're not amazing right uh but you, know he's a depressing guy to read but he also pokes fun at his own depression which makes him doubly interesting you, know so what is an erroneous way to understand the superstructure or ideology well, first of all he says yeah we all acknowledge that idea ideology is distinct from the structure it is, asserted that a given political situation solution is ideological that means that it is insufficient for, changing the structure although it thinks that it can do so but on these correct premises is drawn the conclusion, that every ideology is pure appearance useless stupid but that's the wrong conclusion to come, to just because something is a product of capitalism just because something is a product even of feudalism doesn't mean, that you can just dispense with it and say that culture was just useless culture Sufism good God they think that, the material and sufis you know this sufis don't believe that the material world as such exists as a material world, they believe everything is basically the emanation of an idea you know it's it's, it's light all of it is light they believe that that's what the suburb is that's what uh, is totally anti-materialist but does that mean I can dismiss all of that because I'm a, materialist and I believe this table actually does exist it's not light does that mean I should dismiss all the Sufi, tradition stop listening stop listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and all the great poetry and all the great heritage Etc and just dismiss it out of hand and say to, means nothing to me because it is pure idealism no you can't do this would be non-serious attitudes he says you can't, dismiss all of it as mere parents useless and stupid no what you've got to understand is that, there you he makes the distinction also between organic and arbitrary organic ideologies are necessary for a given, structure arbitrary ideologies only create individual movements and polemics and so on so first of all you and, foremost you've got to sift the chaff and the grain right you've got to understand that there are lots of ideas, in society some are truly arbitrarily temporary and so on so forth and can be, dismissed but organic ideas that are Central to systems to social systems must be treated with greater care, these are relatively permanent organic ideology will lead to organic movements, that are relatively permanent and these must be separated from conjunctual and arbitrary ideologies and movements that, are occasionally immediate and accidental a common error though consists in an ability in in our, inability to find the correct relationship between what is organic and what is conjunctual so what is now going, to show you is that even that which is conjunctional cannot always be dismissed in the first case there is an excess of, economism or doctrinal pedantry the overestimation of mechanical causes in, the second in excess of ideologism which is the exaggeration of volunteerism and individualistic element so you can have, an exaggeration of ideologism here and an exaggeration of overestimation of mechanical causes when you're looking at, at these courses and you've got to stop doing that you've got to understand the complex interrelationship between, organic between organic ideas organic movements conjunctional movements arbitrary, ideologies they come together in complex ways and we've got to understand them if you want to make real social change he's, a real Craftsman I mean he's sitting in jail but you can give him credit that, he's a real Craftsman he's explaining to you if you want to bring about the feminist Revolution if you want to bring, about a revolution against extremism if you want the end of you know in Pakistan you want the end of I don't know XYZ, oppression of minorities how do you do it how do you convince people how do you, make it happen he is he is the an architect an engineer you could even call him an artist of how to create, construct social movements in any given context or to understand and then create, them so to understand and create them you have to understand the relations of forces who's strong what is the balance, of power we've got to distinguish he says between relations of social forces that is, linked to structure objective independent of human will and in the economic relations between classes then, you've got to look at the relations of political forces Ponzi parties stronger stronger how many people were there at, the climate March who are the enemies of the climate how many others went to the climate March okay right okay there you, go you know who are they what are their views how do they convince people that climate is unimportant you got to, understand that and the mechanics of that right and finally he says between classes or between nations is also the, balance of force of military who's got a stronger military he says that also plays an important role so let's go, through them the first one is kind of self-explanatory so he doesn't really bother with that which is the economy, right the second one he goes into what about politics what happens in politics well he says in politics, social movements evolve at three different levels you can divide them into three different kinds of social movements the first are economic, corporate level which is that people come together for their immediate economic interests uh for example a, trade Union in one place or a student union that you may form and you may say alums we're going to come together to, improve the food at PDC I wish you would not that it's that bad but anyway but that what is that that is an economic, corporate level stuff then you don't Unite with all students here you unite, only with lump students for lumps demands then what if all students combined he says that would be the economic class level it would be where, you'd Advance common interests of the working class common interests of the of students or whatever the case is but, these are still economic interests you're still not vying for political power the third stage is the political, level he says formation of political parties to contest for hegemony over other subordinate groups now you form a, political party of whoever it is represent and then you try to build alliances with others in order to win, the struggle right so he says this is the highest level this is a picture which is quite you can't really see it, quite well and are going to really move to the light but it's the picture of the chartists which was the first working, class party to be created in mid-19th Century England, and then finally he comes to military force quite shocking that he's discussing this while sitting in prison, but he does a trick with it he discusses it but he doesn't talk about classes anymore he talks about Nations because, when he talks about Nations then nobody can object but you can see that he actually means because his interest is not National War but class war right so, he says Independence cannot be won with purely military forces it requires both military and political military ones so, you've got to have you got to combine politics and Military in order to win these sorts of struggles military is, also important though he's trying to say the oppressed Nation he says but actually what he means is the class, will therefore initially oppose the dominant military force with the force which is only political military you, can't have a head-on confrontation with a stronger opponent okay it's just stupid it's not about courage or whatnot, he's trying to say to you you cannot take on the American Military just head on and say Here I Am Rock You Like a, Hurricane no you can't do that right it used to be a famous song when we were kids so what do you do you have to have a, political strategy you have to try to destroy the war potential of the dominant Nation from within that sounds, of Fifth Generation War and you have to compel the dominant military force to, thin out and disperse over a large territory thus nullifying a great power part of its War potential so you've got, to find the right way in which their strategic strength is cannot be deployed against you in one go otherwise you'll, be wiped out so it's like a smaller boxer fighting a bigger boxer the smaller boxers got to keep his distance, he can't get in there and just say all right I'll take your punch and I'll give you one no no can't do that he's got to, go around him he's got to maneuver around him he's going to punch you know find the loopholes Etc never take a, full-on punch from the other side yeah so what about economic crisis in 2008 we, had a huge massive economic crisis and a lot of times we think that an economic crisis ought to generate resistance, against capitalism but then we see Donald Trump get up then we see Boris Johnson come up when we see Le Pen, get up Etc we see all we see Narendra Modi get up not Narendra sorry Narendra Modi Modi get up right you see also you, don't see the left I mean in fact in India the left has gone backwards it used to have 62 seats in Parliament, today it has five in the National Assembly of course they have enormous seats at this provincial level so they, dominate the provincial governments of Kerala and West Bengal and other places Etc but at the national level they've, all the way back to five seats so what's going on so he says gramshi says it may be ruled, out that immediate economic crisis themselves produce fundamental historical events they can simply create a Terrain more favorable to the, dissemination of certain modes of thought and certain and certain ways of posing and resolving questions involving, the entire subsequent development of National Life they create the potentiality that you can that a certain, new idea can become popular but don't make the mistake of thinking that just because Pakistan, is going down economically the left is going to go up politically that's not that's not the way reality, works is explained to you for example the French Revolution did not occur only owing to endemic poverty but also, conflicts related to class prestige played a very important role in the, French Revolution he says and you can't dismiss that economic crisis can lead to contradictory outcomes he says the old, Society may decide to resist and may ensure its itself breathing space by, crushing the opposition or a reciprocal destruction of contending classes and the Peace of the gradia graveyard may be, established perhaps even under the surveillance of a foreign God so it's not at all necessary that you, know just because you represent the truth and the poor and the downtrodden the oppressed that Victory will be yours, in any given specific conflict, so what how do we analyze this and what's the purpose of our analysis if we want to change the world how do we, change the world gramshi can be re the prison read notebooks can be written the prison notebooks or how to change the, world you know you could just recall it that right how do you change the world he says the purpose of analysis is to, reveal the points of least resistance at which the force of will can be most, fruitfully applied this is I think this is genius okay if you're going to try and, change anything in society this is you should put this on your T-shirt or something why because you can't attack everywhere, and you can't attack everything okay some places you attack and those places, are very heavily defended and guarded and those ideas are very strongly entrenched those forces are very, strongly entrenched and all you're going to do by attacking those places is in fact you're going to multiply the, resistance against you you're going to make yourself weaker rather than Stronger by attacking where you are weak, and they are strong ok but if you attack some place where they, are weak and you are strong you are on the right moral ground and people support you and say yeah I don't agree, with everything temu says but on this question you know competitive federalism is the way to go or whatever the case, may be because that's that's shamal's favorite sort of pet project the point is you know if you attack on that on on, on on the pitch where you have a winning chance there then you win lots of people, who are otherwise not necessarily with you and that's what gramshi wants to do they suggest immediate tactical operations, what suggested your analysis shows where where are they strongest where are they, weakest where do I need to attack in order to win for example the the women's scores you tell me where would you need, to attack in order to destroy or undermine patriarchy what would be the weak point of patriarchy what point, would you attack at which you know um you would gain allies and those who, support patriarchy would lose allies versus what are the points where if you attack patriarchy on that point the, Patriarchs would gain allies and you would lose allies those are the things that you need to think about in any, movement whether it's patriarchy or class politics or Democratic politics take General Musharraf right so when I, when I was when I started teaching here at Lums a few years after I started, teaching here at Lums General Musharraf came to power and I have always been opposed to military dictatorship in, Pakistan and I opposed General Musharraf but a huge section of people who are can, be called liberal or Progressive or Democratic said no General he's a nice, guy I said why is he a nice guy he said you know he's got these two doggies and you know he likes music and he likes, Russian Kelly and so on and he did he does that's true and he was a you know as far as military dictators go because, I was born in the period when before Isaiah came actually I grew up in the period when Zaya came compared to, military dictators he was a pretty softly military dictator I got to tell you that right but the point is, so do I start attacking him on the fact that he's got to holding two puppies and that he likes music and stuff and how, horrible no but when he made that comment about uh the woman that claimed, that she was raped and he said that uh you know uh maybe she made that claim, because she wanted a Visa and so on uh and then you know when you made that, point when you sort of said hang on a second this is not on and you made that, a strategic part of your campaign then that was a really weak Wicket Musharraf was wrong footed He didn't know where, the ball was coming or going right so then you could it wasn't just that comment but then you said you know we, don't want a ruler like that you made that a point of entry for military dictatorship as a whole to give another, example Imran Khan's doing the same thing I mean he understood a lot a while ago one very important thing which is, that the political Elite all of it of Pakistan is corrupt right so either I, get with the game which he tried to do for a while but there wasn't much of a game to be had because everybody's, already taken the big seats and what he was being offered was well not worth taking and he did the right thing by not, taking it although Musharraf in fact offered him the prime ministership and so on but he was like no it doesn't make, any sense because I have one seat in Parliament and blah blah blah so he understood that so he understood that, one thing that I can do though is I can get these guys on the fact that they are all bloody corrupt so if I make that the, main part of my campaign that's a winning strategy right so he makes he, makes his party tarike what is it what is it oh yeah sorry in South right, I I did that deliberately anyway, you get the picture um mix that the center Plank and then drives that through like a like a pile, driver right that's all he can he can talk about it's like almost like Imran Khan can't talk about anything else Under the Sun but now he's so in keyed, into that that one year into government and he's still talking about that instead of getting on with the act of running the country, so sorry if anybody is pro PTI and feels rather unhappy about that comment the, point is only to illustrate to you that to win in politics Grandview is saying, you've got to attack with the enemy is weak and you are strong an analysis helps you find that they, indicate how campaign of political agitation may be May best be launched what language will best be understood by, the masses what will give you greater and greater support for your course, um so finally to conclude he says this whole thing of economism understanding, everything through economics and not being having not having this ability to look at things in this nuanced way he, says is a legacy really not a Marxism but of liberalism economic economism is not Marxism but the direct descendant of, liberalism the state and Civil Society are one in the sense that they serve the same class the latter though that is the, state Works through coercion and the former Civil Society Works through ideological hegemony and this is again, another key point of gramshi he says that trade unionism for example he says, although it belongs to the subaltern class to poor people uh and they uh but the independence in, the Germany of the subordinate group is in fact sacrificed to the intellectual hegemony of the ruling class because trade unionism is an aspect of, laissez-faire liberalism or laissez-faire capitalism right so trade unionism is supposed to restrict the, Revolt of the working class only to negotiating the wage whereas what, gramshi wants them to do is to question the wage system I.E capitalism itself, to continue the problem of emancipation is not considered either the problem of emancipation is not considered as in, fabianism demand or the labor party or pose in an appropriate and infected form for example social democracy or, because of a belief in the possibility of Leaping from class or a society directly into a society of perfect equality with the cynical cynical, economy it is it is left completely open so trade unionism is not a successful, strategy subaltern strategy because even though it is a subaltern movement this is a very cool concept you can have, subaltern movements that don't realize that they are conceding ideological, hegemony to their enemy you can have movements of women who do not realize that in fact they are conceding hegemony, to patriarchy by let's say undertaking a certain slogan or workers movements or, whatever the case may be and gramsi wants you to be able to sift that and understand where you are seeding, essential ground where you are seeding the where you are conceding to your opponent the the the the the the, hegemonic idea there you are basically in trouble you're not going to win even, though you may make a very big splash and get your picture on social media but you can't will not get what you want, also he says this whole tendency we must not compromise we must be uncompromising, in struggle though that is the enemy we are the good guys the good guys fight the bad guys and never in any Hollywood, movie have I seen the good guys have a pleasant conversation with a bad guy except for James Bond uh hence therefore, you know you are on that side and they're going to be no compromise he, says this is not how politics works politics cannot you cannot be successful, if you think in this way in fact hegemony says presupposes compromises, with other interests you want your movement to be successful you've got to compromise with other movements in order, to win them as allies in order to be successful the leading group should make, sacrifice of an economic corporate kind without touching the essential don't give up on your essential but, nonetheless make allies in the big fight against isolate your enemy and fight, against them all forms of electric electoral abstentions also belong to economism or liberalism so that's why he, says okay you know we often think oh the law is against us you know the police is, horrible terrible yeah it is yes the law may not be in your favor oh parliaments, are corrupt or politics is all corrupt we're not going to do any of that what's the result of that it's a, self-defeating strategy you've got to get in the mud he says is what gram she's saying you've got to get into the, mud and you've got to meet with the policewalas and you've got to say here's a gender sensitization program for you, but if you use the word gender sensitization they're going to run the other way so how do you how do you get, in there and get your point of view or here's a labor sensitization program whatever it is how do you maneuver and, convince people that you that the changes that you want to bring about are good that always requires he's saying, compromises and getting into those even into those institutions that you may or, may not necessarily agree with or like creative founded went on to completely, overshadow the Socialist Party of Italy and became the LA one of the largest, communist parties in Europe uh it became massive and gramshi himself, obviously became an intellectual who's read all over the world for precisely, doing what you're saying he perhaps should not have done but he thinks this is a better strategy so he breaks with, them because he thinks they don't have the right strategy he's got it he can do it better and due to a very large extent he does, he does it better in my view um most of the Italian Socialist Party in fact leaves the leadership and joins, gramshi's party later so what gramshi is saying aside from his, strategic vision is very similar to what to what Marx and Engels would have also agreed with for, example the Marx engel's rights according to the materials conception of History the ultimately determining element in history is a production and, reproduction of real life other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted hence if somebody twists this, into saying that the economic element is the only determining one he transforms, that proposition into a meaningless abstract senseless phrase to say that everything can be understood from, economics is not what we are saying okay um similarly gramshi continues that, economism which is he also Associates with the Italian common Socialist Party, um makes no distinction between the relatively permanent organic movement and the fluctuating arbitrary movement, it cannot these are his criticisms all these economic development is reduced to technical change in the instruments of, work it cannot even examine Economic Development very well it is utterly false that people will allow themselves, to be moved by considerations of self-interest and it is entirely true that they are above all motivated by, desire for and Ardent belief in Prestige something that Max Weber talks about, Prestige and Status plays a very important role in our our self-image and, can play a very very important role in how we view our position in society and whether or not we revolt or conform to, society and gramshi is agreeing there economism asks the question who profits directly from the initiative under, consideration and replies with a line of reasoning which is as simplistic as it is relationship the one who profits, directly at a certain fraction of the ruling class and then they get into this argument is Nawaz Sharif benefiting from this, whole politics then begins to dissolve around a few individuals which really is what's going on in Pakistan as well the, whole political question becomes around a few individuals and their economic benefits rather than real questions, about what's what those policies mean for people we start looking for whether, XYZ policy is benefited Imran Khan whether it's benefited whether it's benefit to zadari but that's not all, politics is about you've got to look at how XYZ policy has impacted the people the country as a whole that's, what politics ought to be about so that's the political struggle is reduced to a series of personal affairs, between the one between on the one hand those with the genie in the lamp who know everything on the other those who, are fooled by their own leaders but are so incurably thick that they refuse to believe it, right that's what I mean ramshi seems to be describing Pakistani politics, perfectly because that's what we do all the time right we only pick on things which we think have benefited those, politicians then we make them into big scandals and that's the whole thing that politics revolves around I know time's, up um he wants you to look at the social content of the mass following the, movement what function did this Mass have in the balance of forces what is the political significance of the, demands presented by the leaders you examine the Conformity of the means to the ends what do they want how are they, trying to get it are the two things working together well and only in the last analysis and formulated in the, political and not moralistic terms is the hypothesis considered that such movements would necessarily be perverted, and serve quite different and from those which the mass of the followers expect you've got to start analyzing the, movements for who is in them what are they doing what are their demands, is oh the flannel leaders corrupt and we think that's the end-all and be all of politics we do this all, the time in Pakistani politics he says this is useless get out of there last but not least he has an aversion to, historicism what is that the aversion to compromises is based on the iron conviction that there exists objective, laws of historical development similar and kind to Natural laws together with a belief in a predetermined theology like, that of a religion since favorable conditions are inevitably going to appear and since these in a rather mysterious way would bring about, genetic events it is evident that any deliberate initiative tending to predispose and plan these conditions is, not only useless but even harmful in other words we have become anti-planning we don't want to plan anything because, we think spontaneously history is on my side the truth is on my, side he says it doesn't happen that way the strong uh with those with better, strategy win over those with bad strategy that's how politics really, works so this religious like belief you know we like to watch these movies and in all the movies we watch the good guys, always win there was one movie I watched in which the bad guy won which is called No Country for Old Men and swear I wanted, to go up to the ticket counter and say give me my money back I didn't get my money's worth because we want to believe, the good guys always win but that's not history uh you know you must remember John, Stuart Mill making the same point he made it so eloquently and brilliantly in the case of Jesus Christ right he says, yeah he was a good guy but he didn't win right okay later on Christianity one but, Jesus himself didn't win because to win you not only have to be that's all about Game of Thrones is all, about it's not enough to be a good guy otherwise Ned Stark wouldn't have had his head chopped off in the very first, bloody season he was a good guy he got it's not enough to be a good guy you've, got to know how to play the game and interestingly that reference to Machiavelli is made also, because that's very much Machiavelli right you got to know how to play politics that reference to Machiavelli, is very much there also in the writing of gramshi who often refers to his own, party uh you know the Communist party as the new Prince the modern Prince he, calls it you know saying that you've got to be as smart as Machiavelli wanted you to be in order to make the revolution, right finally gramshi his this beautiful, I want to end with this beautiful quote the old world is dying away and the News, World struggles to come forth now is the time of monsters, climate change I don't know Donald Trump Narendra Modi whoever you want to put in, that category thank you, , ,
