[The Imprisoned Philosopher] folks today we are going to study Antonio gramsci and the way we're going, to manage our examination of gramshi is that as, you know I gave you one reading but I broke it up into two parts so we'll be looking at the first part which is, approximately 32 pages in which his focus is uh his criticism of economism, what we call economism but in the process of criticizing economism you see, that he develops many many interesting new and different ideas about hegemony, about political and Civil Society about the state about the relationship between, the economic base and the superstructure and so on and all of those ideas are very very pertinent although they all, emerge out of the singular strand of criticizing economism um I hope that most of you have done the, reading can you can we just do a quick show of hands to see who has attempted the reading, okay that's wonderful and how many people felt comfortable with it uh uh you know that it was it was okay in, terms of the difficulty level I managed to get maybe 60 70 percent of it, okay found the reading too difficult stopped reading because it was too, difficult didn't read because it was too difficult okay didn't read it at all, okay so I completely empathize with those who were are unable to, sort of extract from the reading what's going on because well there's two major reasons for that, the first is that gramshi is responding to various people in his own time frame, who are writing about Marxism writing on behalf of Marxism or writing against, Marxism and so in responding to them he's more or less assuming that you know the, people or at least know the arguments that those people have made and that you're familiar with both Marxism as, well as the arguments with which he's dealing so it's kind of again once again a situation where you're entering into a, debate in the middle of the debate rather than being introduced to all the terms that's the first major difficulty, the second major difficulty is that these writings were writings that gramshi wrote while he was in prison and, so the access that he had to various books and sources of information were, naturally limited although he did have access to some but it was not by his choice what he had, access to moreover he had to write things in a way that sometimes he was, using terms deliberately he was using code names or rather he was changing the, terms he could have written it much more simply for example he could have just said the philosophy of Marxism says XYZ, but you'll notice or Marxism says XYZ but you notice he doesn't use that term he uses the term the philosophy of, Praxis leaving many of us thinking what is that and how is that different from Marxism and how does that relate to, everything and so on and he uses a number of terms in this particular way for example there are a number of, passages where he writes about Nations fighting in military Wars whereas you, can very clearly see that what he really means is class is fighting in them the reason why he can't write classes is, because everything is right he's writing is going to be read by the prison authorities so he has to somewhat change, the meaning here and there in order for it to pass the sensors and you really have to be sort of more or less aware, what he's getting at in order to really understand what he's talking about so for these two reasons number one the, fact that he's jumping into the middle of the debate sorry you're jumping into the middle of a debate that you're not, familiar with you need a prior knowledge of Marxism and the debates around it and for the, reason that he's trying to avoid the prison sensor otherwise the Pres the sensor of the prison will say sorry but, we're confiscating these writings we're not going to allow them to be given to your family or your friends or comrades, or whatnot so he's trying to avoid that and thirdly of course he's writing mostly out of memory what a phenomenal, memory he had really to be so productive in prison is quite phenomenal interestingly fairs Ahmed fares uh the, great Pakistani poet and critic of the establishment and left-wing Progressive, figure the iconic left-wing Progressive figure of Pakistan also wrote most of, his most famous poems while being in prison I think the reason why people get so productive sometimes in prison is, that they get an awful amount of time they have nothing at all to do with uh, because there's you know I mean there's really nothing you can do while you're sitting there so some people like to you, know sort of hit the gym and work out and become huge and other people like to read and write and so on and write, phenomenal things another great example of someone who really developed intellectually while being in prison is, Malcolm X who went into prison for one reason and came out of prison a, completely reformed and changed person ready and willing to fight for the rights of the African-American community, so but this is a particularly brutal prison and it was particularly brutal for gramshi because this is a prison, under Italian fascism and they of course had no love lost for for Antonio gramsci, and it was very difficult for gramshi as well because he had very developed he already had and further developed very, very serious health problems while in prison and died at a very young age and, so you can imagine that this is this was you know no walk in the park so to speak, so gramshi gets his name from a town in eastern Albania which is called grams, and that's just changed into its Italian sort of name gramshi he wasn't born in, in Albania but it's probably his grandparents or his great-grandparents were born there and they migrated to, Italy but they kept the the surname of the village it's a bit like what happens in Pakistan that many of us have uh if, you're not so Urban as as you people are many of us will have surnames that belong to our our Villages Etc you know, we'll have I don't know Faisal lalpuri or something you know and so on so, that's the name that the family retained he was uh he grew up he was born and he grew up in this, um in Sardina which is uh as you can see in Ireland which is part of Italy his, father was in 1898 convicted of corruption probably there was a PTI, government at the time who knows and uh and he was then uh imprisoned and as a, consequence of the imprisonment of his father uh the family was became, completely destitute not that they were very well off before but now they became very very poor in fact they became so, poor that gramsi had to stop his schooling and said and had to do work in order to make I had to do odd jobs to, make ends meet um finally his father was released in 1904 and gram she could then thereafter, continuous schooling and so on so forth gramshi suffered from child from from very early on from his childhood with, very very severe health problems uh he had a terrible malformation of the spine which stunted his growth and meant that, he was not even five feet tall he was shorter than five feet tall and he had he was hunchbacked because of that, malformation of the spine and for the longest time the gramshi family believed that his caretaker had accidentally, dropped him when he was a kid and that's why his spine something wrong happened to his spine but subsequent research has, sort of proven that he had a disease which caused that malformation to occur that's gramsi at the age of 15. uh very, Italian looking boy as you can see that's his father and that's his mother with his sister just thought I'd share, those photographs with you there aren't a lot of photographs of Antonio gramci um actually there's only a couple and I, try to make do with the ones that were available I went to a website called uh the international gramshi society which, had these very rare photographs which are not often shared um or not often public I mean I'm, they're not secret or anything um so yeah I think one of the reasons is that he spent most of his adult life, Behind Bars and obviously people were not really he was there was not going to be a photographer to go there and have a, look at him in 1911 when gramshi was he was a brilliant student and in 1911 he managed, to win a scholarship to this amazing University that's the University of Turin and which is of course where he, made his name as a leftist and so on so forth I don't know if you can see this very clearly because of the light but, you know you can look at the architecture it's absolutely magnificent looks like a palace and the and the lawn, over here is perfectly manicured with a design on it which of course needs a lot, of work to do something of that sort so a highly you know sort of an elite University of a very you know sort of, good University where he you know he really excelled in philosophy and, other things and I think he really came into his own in 1913 soon after University, he joined the Italian Socialist Party now just a note here that this is uh the, Italian Socialist Party was already a pretty strong party and Italy already had its own working-class tradition and, so on and so the Italian Socialist Party at this particular stage isn't really as such connected to Lenin and so on so, forth It's its own very much its own party by 1916 he you know showed himself, to be a very good writer he was writing on working-class issues on their struggles in Turin and so on and so in, his own town he became the co-editor of Avante which means forward of the, Socialist the the party's official newspaper these newspapers are quite, significant in Europe but in also in India and other parts of Asia where the newspapers of the Social, Democratic party or the Socialist Party or the Communist Party enjoy wide circulation and I read more or less like, Jung and Nevada more or less like daily papers in Pakistan party newspapers tend, to be extremely tiny 500 a thousand circulation but in other parts of the, world party newspapers can be very very major newspapers for example in the United Kingdom one of the newspapers, that you can pick up from the newsstand is called the morning star and that's actually the newspaper of the Communist, Party of Britain similarly humanity is a the paper of the humanity is the paper of, the Communists used to be the paper of the Communist Party of France and so on so, um by 1919 he had set up his own weekly newspaper which was called the New Order, the Italian Socialist Party was commit was you know a very diverse sort of group of people so they were all, socialists in one way or another but it was a it was relatively speaking quite uh it had still had a very diverse uh, sort of ideological spread and because of that diversity it also you know there was also a lot of factional infighting, Etc and gramsi thought that it wasn't a very effective party and by 1919 of course the Bolshevik, Revolution has occurred which is in 1917 in Russia the Russian Revolution and, gramshi is very much attracted to Lenin's style of leadership uh his PO, his party his understanding of how to do politics and so on so forth and what gramci wants to do is to create a, Marxist leninist party in the context of Italy and the newspaper that he takes out this new weekly newspaper the New, Order is more or less dedicated to this that particular function that we are going to popularize Lenin's ideas and, create in Italy a party like the Bolshevik party in Russia, um in 19 from between 1919 and 1920 Turin where gramshi is an activist and, working and organizing workers experiences big Mass working class strikes really really huge strikes but, sadly by 1920 they are defeated by the way across Europe at that time from 1917 18 1990 up to 1920 there are, strikes and protests and revolutionary movements in almost every part of Europe Germany Australian Empire everywhere, these strikes have a very deep impact on gramshi he observes them very closely he's working with them very closely, observes the workers very closely he observes how they organize and he's very much influenced not just by the, literature that he's reading coming in from Russia but very much by his experiences they're amongst working, people he himself is a belongs to you know the working class as a whole, um by January 1921 gramshi com uh is able to gather enough support together, with another leader called bordiga together they're able to gather enough support to say we don't want to stay, with the Italian Socialist Party we are going to create a new party which is called the Italian Communist party which, actually goes on for towards you know sort of enormous success dogliati is the, big leader of the Italian was the big leader of the Italian communist movement interestingly togliati was also a, student at the University of Turin when gram she was a student there there were students together there okay, soon after the formation of the Italian Communist Party, um it was it followed there was a period of repression against the party in 1926, the fascist government enacted emergency laws that's Mussolini's government, on the pretext that there was an attempt an alleged attempt on Mussolini's life, and so after that the police had already arrested Bodega but now had also, arrested Antonio gramshi despite the fact that he ought to have had parliamentary immunity at his trial, gramshi's prosecutor stated for 20 years we must stop this brain from functioning, and he received a 20-year sentence where he was incarcerated and that's a, one of the shots that we have of him while he was imprisoned after about 11 years in prison his health had, deteriorated enormously his teeth had fallen out his digestive system had collapsed he couldn't eat solid foods, and he had convulsions when he vomited blood he suffered headache so violent that he beat his head against the walls, of his cell so you know he was really in a very bad state in prison there was in, fact an international campaign for his release from Cambridge University from professors at Cambridge University, he was due to be released due to be released on April 21st 1937 but he had, become so ill by that time that he couldn't really be moved he had a number of sort of diseases many of which are so, difficult that I can't even pronounce them but artery arteriosclerosis pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure vagina gout acute gastric disorders good God he was in a, terrible State and when he his release date was 21st April by 27 April 1937 he, passed away only at the age of 46. when I think about that it depresses me because that means I only have two more, years to go if I was gramshi and so his ashes are buried here that's, his uh that's his tomb Etc uh but in this period and despite all this ill health, he managed to write 30 notebooks over 3000 pages on history on politics and on, philosophy and so on So You know despite all these difficulties he was quite prolific in his intellectual output had, he lived longer you know we could have expected more great things from him, his contribution to uh the intellectual Heritage that of humanity includes his, ideas about cultural hegemony which we discussed in nearly all social science courses, um as a means of legitimize the capitalist State the idea of organic intellectuals what are organic, intellectuals versus technocratic intellectuals his distinction between political society and Civil Society what, are the what what is that distinction how do we understand it uh his critique of historicism and economic determinism, which is I think one of the key elements in his entire thing because a lot of others a lot of his other Concepts like, the distinction between political and Civil Society cultural hegemony organic intellectuals really flow out of his, this main concern of uh of how do we understand economic determinism and, historicism and so on I'll explain these terms in just a bit what do I mean by economic determinism and historicism and, finally his critique of pre-marxist materialism and there are loads of other things as, well I mean on Italian history on world history and so on but these are just some of the main very very big, influences that people widely acknowledge so where do we begin so that was his, life in a nutshell very very briefly Where Do We Begin how do we begin to understand, gramsi's actual thought in order to understand gramshi we've got to First understand Karl Marx, and in order to understand Karl Marx we have to be on the correct slide right so now to understand, gramsi we've got to understand how Marx understood history and his criticism of, capitalist Society and of course one can you know Marx was a, prolific writer the collected works of Marx and Engels are 52 volumes and you, can go all over the place you know looking at nuances and so on so forth but the passage that is perhaps most, widely quoted is this one in front of you in which he sort of very quickly, sums up this is the preface to uh what is it the critique of political economy, Etc in which he very quickly tries to sum up in a few sentences the way that, he wants us to understand history or examine history and inevitably because it's a preface and because it's a very, very brief statement it runs the risk of being misunderstood misinterpreted or you know sort of uh there is potential, for distorting how Marx understood things if you just read one passage as there is a similar potential in Reading, any passage outside of the larger context in which it is being written but, nonetheless this is one of the most widely cited passages out of Marx's work and very very influential for that, reason so let's read through this passage try and understand what he's saying so he says in the social production, I have a red dot in the social production of their existence men and by, men here he means human beings in German they often you know sort of they write men all the time whether they mean human, beings am I right about that it's non-gendered is it not is it non-gendered, male yes thank you I don't know any German but I know that and a few other, things um so humans inevitably enter into definite relations which are independent, of their will so let's stop there just for a second to produce and reproduce life we cannot, produce and reproduce life individually we have to enter into social relations, right we have to enter into relations with each other as uh to to have children obviously we have to enter into, sexual relations to uh to produce the necessities of life food clothing, shelter we have to work together at some level cooperate with each other at some level to protect ourselves against, animals that may try and hurt us and so on so forth we have to work together, so what what does he mean that they're independent of our will what he means by that is that these relations that we, form with each other are not relations that we can merely pick and choose but they are in, accordance with the circumstances in which we exist if we are living in the jungle we'll have to evolve certain kind, of relations if we're living in the mountains if we're living in the whatever our material conditions are, those will determine what kind of relations we have to we can create namely the relations of production, appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of, production so what are these relations these are relations of production and reproduction and they have to be appropriate to the, level of development of their material forces of production so what is material, forces of production mean it means our ability to produce what stage are we at, in terms of our what kind of relationship do we have with nature to what extent are we able to manipulate, nature such that we are able to benefit from it though that will determine what, sort of relations we also have with each other in other words the stage of our, development of economic uh our economic technology our ability to produce in, turn the tools we use the kind of tools we have created in turn also determine, how you and I are going to what sort of social relations you and I are going to have with each other in in that process, of our work and production so in an advanced Society with a high, degree of Technology you will have relations that may be very different for example if you have a society where you, could have meetings that are online or you could wear a little workout, what is that called virtual mask and have a meeting with somebody sitting in, Tokyo right and it would seem like you're sitting in the same boardroom right as happens in Sci-Fi movies, Etc well then that would mean that you could have a boardroom meeting without traveling from one part of the world to, the other part of the world and that would mean of course certain things about what sort of relations you would have these days to give you another, example which is may be more pertinent to or you can relate to it much better these days you have thousands of friends, on Facebook and on social media and you know and you are impacted by them, and of course you can read articles about how they are not really friends they're just you know sort of social, media friends and real friends are the ones that you actually get to hang out with and spend time with and so on and I, I think there's something I think that argument is not incorrect because there is something to real one-on-one, interaction versus reading somebody's comment on a screen but at the same time it has to be said that those comments on, the screen have a huge impact on your on your uh on your uh image of yourself on, your estimation of yourself on your self-esteem you get a bad comment in the morning you know somebody says you know, uh something like this is a dumb thing that you shared and you don't know your, satra from your surface so whatever they say you know you don't know anything blah blah blah, and you're going to be a bit depressed throughout the day because those are real people they are not robots and, they're writing to real people and they do have a psychological impact that's why people can be Cyber Bullied that's, why people can fall in love even on the over the over social media or chase each other and so on so forth so, for that reason while social media cannot certainly substitute for real relationships, one-on-one real relationships it is a relationship of some sort a different one from the one that you have sitting, in front of each other you could be in contact with somebody who's sitting in Canada on a daily basis and not be in, touch with somebody who is your roommate you know depending on how much time you spend on the internet versus talking to, your roommate so what I'm trying to say is technology changes the way we can talk, to each other we can relate to each other who we can relate to at any given point in time you know how how many, people we can relate to and so on so forth it does change that and I'm only talking about communication here Marx is, talking about the process through which we come together and work together and, that can be changed by the kinds of tools available to us so he says the totality of these relations of, production that is the way in which we come together in order to produce all of them put together totality means if you, take all of those relations in any given Society you put them all together that constitutes the economic structure of, society the real foundation on which arises a legal and political, superstructure so before we go into the superstructure let's just look at that so if you put together all the, relationships that you have let's look at some of the relationships that that are immediately observable around you, first of all there's the relationship that you and I or you have with your professors then there's a relationship, that you have with the staff of of uh or with each other then you have a relationship with the staff that works, here somebody of course does the cooking and you go and eat in PDC somebody does, the cleaning the gardening somebody guards there are people who guard the your University and so on so forth and, we even though we may not say hello to them we may not might not exchange your pleasantries with them but we really, actually do have a certain relationship with them which keeps us where we are at, even if we don't want to recognize that but that is the objective reality so that he says you put all of that, together that's the economic Foundation that's the economic structure of a given society and it's on that economic, structure Mark says that all your ideas your ideology your thought processes, your culture your laws Etc your legal and political institutions they are, really reflecting or based on those economic relationships relationships, that we enter into as we produce and to these legal politicals to this, legal political superstructure and to the economic structure correspond definite forms of social Consciousness, so our ideas are correspond to our relationships and those relationships, are the real relationships that we have in the process of production who does, what work what role do they have in society in that work what benefits do they get out of society for doing that, work and so on those are very very important in determining the political institutions which in turn are very very, instrumental in determining our thought processes about institutions about work, about life about uh politics about economics so on so forth, the mode of production of material life he says conditions the general process of social political and intellectual, life so the way that you come together for work determines the way that you, come together for everything else consider that we belong to most of us, perhaps belong to the middle class to the upper middle class to the upper class Etc consider that and to no fault, of your own because that's just the way Society is structured so this is not a moralistic thing I'm not pointing a finger at you but consider that most of, our friends will be from the same class that we are from they will be from, neither from the class that's above us nor from the class that's below us the class that's below us will not we will, not befriend because well first of all we don't really have too much interaction with them aside from ordering them about, perhaps right and secondly there is a stigma attached to that right where sort, of oh my God he's hanging out with he's slumming it or whatnot Etc right I mean there is a sort of coolness to be to be, part of the the cool crowd and the cool crowd is going to be the elite of Any Given Society mostly I'm not saying, 

everybody thinks that way but mostly societies do think that way that the elite of those societies are considered, to be cool people good you know successful people and people want to hang out with successful people so, consider for example that our social relationships are by and large formed by, our class which in turn is formed by our position our positionality within uh you, know within the mode of production and this occurs nearly from birth this, occurs right from the beginning it occurs so naturally in any person's life that you don't even think that it occurs, for example I'll take myself as an example here I am standing in front of you wearing jeans and a a shirt Etc, speaking in relatively fluent English if not a slightly Punjabi fight English accent Etc right but all of this all of, those things are really to use slightly postmodern language symbols of, particular of a particular class status if I was born in a village my address, would be very different my friends would be very different my language would be very different my thoughts would be very different psychologists do this little, really interesting experiment where they take teenagers or really young kids and, what they do is they they put a coin in front of them there was a coin somewhere over here I thought I saw a coin can't, find it anymore anyway they put a coin in front of homeless children and uh and, in front of children who are you know sort of middle class or upper middle class and they they put a coin in front, of them then they take the coin away and then they ask them to draw the coin on a piece of paper and what they noticed was, that the children who were from poverty always drew the coin slightly larger on, average than the children who uh were from better off homes and so psychologists concluded that you know, there's a part of your brain called the reticular activating system things that you desire this you know you're walking, through a if let's say you're walking through a Superstore and this one chocolate that you really love and, there's all these chocolates on the side but suddenly your brain is programmed in such a way that bang if that chocolate, appears that you really like your mind your eye can pick up that particular chocolate from an array of chocolates, that's how you identify things very quickly that's how you identify familiar faces for example in a crowd of people, you can pick out familiar faces without necessarily looking at every individual phase just look at the crowding like oh, I know that person right how do you do that that's how the there is a there is a mechanism in the mind that allows you, in fact to do that and that works specifically with faces more than with any other object so things that you, desire your mind focuses on um and so children bought in poverty, focus on that so what am I trying to say very perception of the world is, determined you know even perception of how large something is how desirable it is how much you want it is determined by, what you have and what you don't have and what others have it plays a very big, role it's easy to dismiss it and say money means nothing to me but then if you don't have money then you discover, suddenly that if you really really don't have it that it that it deprives you of, many many things that are not necessarily material it's not just that you don't you want to have more stuff, but it deprives you of many many opportunities that can be you know can, result in you having a very low self-esteem a bad image about yourself, or will not give you the potential the ability to really reach your potential, so the mode of production life says Karl Marx determines uh sorry the more the mode the mode of production of material, life conditions the general process of Social and intellectual life it is not so he sums all of this up by saying it, is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but their social existence that determines their, Consciousness so our ideas are determined by our is determined by our, activity and one of the main forms of our activity is the activity of producing together this may seem rather, odd to you people because you are not yet engaged in the process of production given that you're all students and your, right now what we call dependence your parents pay for your food clothing shelter and you're supposed to only, study and you tell your parents yes yes I'm studying which of course you're not doing it all but the point is you're not, yet part of the economy right you're going to become part of the economy soon but as soon as you become part of the, economy it is going to you'll see it's going to take over your life it's going to be 8 hour hours of your day and after, you're done with hopefully you would have been at our job uh but if you do most likely you will and after you're, done with the eight hours of the day you will spend the next eight hours recovering from the eight hours that you, worked and then you'll spend eight hours sleeping so that's basically your life um, taking from experience yes although Lums is quite good in this regard that actually we get we professors at Lums uh, have it quite uh we have quite a bit of spare time which we're supposed to spend reading and researching and writing and, meeting with you people Etc of course we're not doing none of that you're you know you're shaking your head, we do none of that we you know play video games or I don't know what we do but you know the point is that uh, professors at the foreman Christian college for example at FC college at the, same level as myself teach not three courses a year but guess how many, seven they teach seven courses a year exactly so yeah, but you know and that's why I can do Lal band and all the other things you see if I didn't have if I was at FC College, then I really would be putting in you know like I don't know 10 hours a day and uh I wouldn't do be able to do all, the other things that's how all I'm the reason I say that is because I'm trying to show you how the work that you do, determines not just the things that you have but even also the opportunities that you have with respect to your own, time so and obviously the activity you're involved in is basically what you're, going to be thinking about if you don't have time to think about if you if you're sweeping the floors day in, day out and uh you know or you're working in a factory or you are in the, in the grind then you don't have time to think about whether the Big Bang Theory is correct or whether there is an, infinite number of big Banks where the string theory is correct whether quantum mechanics is right or whether the, general theory of relativity by Einstein is right you're not going to have the sources available to you the time to go, through what has been written on that subject to deliberate on those matters you may have the potential you may have, the intelligence you may have the ability but you will not have the opportunity and what are you going to be occupied, with in terms of your mind is going to be the things that you are occupied with in terms of your time, so what we get from this is this sort of a a metaphor of a base and a, superstructure a triangle Marks here is using an architectural sort of metaphor, so we've made a pyramid out of it where the economic the economy is the base and, the superstructure which includes art it includes family it includes culture, religion philosophy law media politics Science Education music literature all, of those things are in the superstructure the base includes excuse me everything related to the, economy the tools use the machines used the factories the land the raw materials, all this stuff and the various classes that are created in the process of production Industrial working class, managerial class so on so forth that's the base now we come to the interesting part so, this was just the background now we come to the interesting part now there is a way to understand what Marx, has written here which can be very narrow and economistic right which is, that everything that happens in the superstructure everything that happens in culture everything that happens in, family religion education politics whatever everything that's written is directly, related to some dire immediately and directly related to some economic direct, economic cause so we try to figure out if we want to know why a particular war is happening, why is America attacking Iraq or what is it doing in Iran Etc we try to find the, economic causes and those can be important but a lot of times States will go to war, even when there isn't a significant economic benefit to be gained and we, know this from history we know this from history that for example the the the the British went to war with, Afghanistan several times two three times in fact not because they thought that Afghanistan had any economic benefit for, them they thought but simply because they wanted to make sure that the Russians don't take over, Afghanistan so they made it into a sort of buffer area so they had no economic they didn't want, to they didn't necessarily want to gain anything economic out of Afghanistan but they wanted to make sure Russia doesn't get in so they went to war in those, places so you can go to war for geostrategic reasons rather than directly economic reasons and so on, so when we understand these sorts of things we cannot therefore conclude that, every action in war in politics in culture is somehow directly related to, economics if we do that we make a caricature uh we we I think we simplify, a human life way too much so so that is called economic, reductionism the idea that everything is economics self-interest governs Nations, and drives the world forward everything is about self-interest class self-interest individual self-interest, State self-interest and so on this is too simplistic and although we use this, as an assumption sometimes to teach for example rational Choice Theory and so on so forth but we also recognize that this, can be a bit overly simplistic when understanding the motivations of people after all people undertake you must have, undertaken many actions that are economically harmful for you but are beneficial in other ways for example you, may have decided you know okay you give you give your friends treats you say okay let's go out for dinner Etc you, don't care about who pays for what Etc with friends why because that's not really what you're concerned with you, the Friendship is much more important to you than you know 10 20 rupees Etc so you don't care about it at that level, and sometimes your friends with people who are actually bad for you and still, yet you're friends with them you know codependent relationships right sometimes you can be in a relationship with someone which is terrible for you, uh for both part Partners in fact for both parties in fact and yet you stick it out in that relationship despite the, fact that any rational analysis would have suggested you should get out of that relationship ASAP but you can't right you can't get out of relationships, in so easily when you are how should I put it when you are invested in those relationships it's not, so easy to say here's the calculus on net my girlfriend has benefited me this much and cost me that much so off with a, head it's not so easy right yes so gramsi is of the view that economic, determinism or reduction sorry before I get to gramsi so economic determinism or economic reductionism is the view that, all political or cultural phenomena are determined by or can be reduced to the economic structure and this is a bit, simplistic overly simplistic Marx did say for example the hand Mill produces, feudalism the steam Mill produces capitalism and it does sound very reductionist to say something of that, sort but you've got to remember that Marx is making these statements in the context of a discussion about history in, or unfolding over tens of thousands of years thousands of years and at that scale to take something that may be true, at that scale that one Society one kind of society will give one kind of economy, will give rise to a particular kind of society another kind of economy will give rise to another kind of economy may, be true at the Grand level of this Grand scale of all of history but it's not, necessarily true you arrive at the Grand scale of History Marx himself says through various accidents and you know, movements that seem to be random and so on so forth and yet you arrive he says, at this thing so gramshi wants to say that in fact when you examine politics, at the everyday level you discover that the base and superstructure don't just, have a relationship one way that the base explains everything in the superstructure but that the relationship, flows both ways the economic base is really shapes and maintains the superstructure, and in turn the superstructure is created in such a way so as to justify legitimize the economic base hence not, every change in politics is the result of Economics economic structure itself is always changing leaders sometimes, make mistakes some decisions are made because of internal necessities of an organizational kind for example a, political party may need to make certain changes etc etc but has nothing to do with the economic base it has to do with, the politics of the time so does that mean you know marxists by, the way I understand that many of you people will be like yeah what's the relevance of all this stuff about, economic base and superstructure how is it sort of you know changing anything in, our lives and so on and I can respect that but I think you've got to appreciate perhaps you've got to, appreciate K you know the understanding that all of history uh the the the idea, that all of history could be understood uh by examining how economic, contradictions had played themselves out is a very powerful idea it's a very uh, it's an idea that has played a very influential role in our times and when, you take that argument and extend it too far and you try to make everything come out of Economics then I think you know, you you take a good solid argument and you make it a bit you know you take any good solid argument make it make it a, bit too extreme then it falls on its face um so I think that's why it's very, important to be able to Define you know to what extent economic in the economy, influences are uh our social decision making political decision making our, ideas and so on but not to go to but not to go to town on it not to go so extreme on it that you know every question has, to have an economic answer and I think that's basically what um gram she's trying to explain to you, is you know how these two Realms interact so for those people who are, who are taking political economy can we have a show of hands or whose major is political economy sorry economics with, politics so this debate about the relationship between the base and the superstructure, is one of the key debates in political economy as a whole how do these two Realms the realm of the economic and the, realm of the political how do they interact with each other that's pretty much what a whole of political economy, is about it's very important for us to be able to tease that out in some way or the other, so gramshi says structure is not a hidden God here he's referring to something that croquet has written that, determines everything structure and superstructure are intimately connected interrelated and act reciprocally, structures and superstructures form a historic block that's a very important, phrase there historic block and I'd like you to please write that down if if you have your notebooks Etc, uh so a historic block is formed out of a structure and a superstructure so superstructure is not merely unimportant, appearances or an unimported to parents it forms the ideological and cultural hegemony necessary for the, legitimization of the state so so we can't just say something is ideological, so it's unimportant Marx has never implied that ideology is unimportant, angles gramshi is trying to just reinforce the fact that to say that the economy, plays a very influential role in how in our conceptions is not to say is not the, same as saying that our conceptions are unimportant in the world of politics and so on so forth not at all and I love, this phrase by gramshi where he says by highlighting the anatomy and the function of the skeleton nobody was, trying to claim that man still as woman can live without skin can live without, the skin so obviously if I'm saying that you know the ma a person stands on the, basis of their bone structure that doesn't mean that if you you can't have a human being with just bones they have, muscles and tissue and skin and everything else and that's the whole organism so to understand Society you, you should liken the economic base to the skeletal structure to the bone structure but that does not mean that, everything else is unimportant of course they interact with each other you can't move a muscle where your bone does not, allow a allow a muscle to move I can't I don't have a joint here so I can't make this thing move backwards actually when, once I fell off a tree I broke both these bones and then my arm was like this for a while which was not fun it, hurt a lot um but given intact bones it's not, possible right so obviously people are exaggerating the argument so the this exaggeration has occurred both by those, who oppose Marxism and even by those who claim to be marxists themselves this happened on both sides of the spectrum, so take for example Jordan Peterson whose favorite hobby horse is to is you, know trying to is always constantly attacking feminists but now he's developed from there to attacking the, left as a whole so the argument that the debate that he had with the uh the crazy fellow, yes uh Zizek who can't stop sniffling all the time, in that debate you must recall Jordan Peterson made it out to seem like Marx is saying that economics determines, everything right so he's pushing marks into economic reductionism so that's really what gramshi is saying that, that's a caricature of what Marxism superstructures are an operational, reality that's an error sorry the it says gramshi that's those are his words superstructures are objective and an, operative in reality Mark spoke about the solidity of popular beliefs and when, this way of concerning and when this way of conceiving things has the force of popular belief this is another phrase, for Marx so when a particular way of thinking about things becomes common, sense that becomes the politics of Common Sense and that is a material real, force that you have to contend with when you enter politics to change society, right did you have a question okay in other words popular conviction has the same energy as a material Force says, Antonio gramsci the philosophy of Praxis here again he means Marxism itself is a, superstructure says gramshi it is the expression of those subaltern classes who want to educate themselves in the, act of government and who have an interest in knowing all truths to give you an example, is Martin Luther King's Junior's famous speech I Have a Dream that one day this, nation will rise up live out the true meaning of its Creed we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men, are created equal has no impact on the economy you can't say it's derived from the economy but it animates an entire uh, social many social movements in fact that are working for civil Democratic, equality and the fact that he can pose it in this particular way is very, significant for example he could have just said we want equality for blacks and we want equality for women and we, want equality for all people right people have been making that speech for ages has had no impact but when he says, it in this way I have a dream why does it resonate with the American public because the American public has been, brought up on the idea of the American dream and so when he relates his dream to the, American dream that's very that's a very powerful articulation of how the, American dream needs to be changed or what the real American Dream ought to have been and so on so forth you see the, point here that's why he's powerful that's why he's effective is because he can do that to give you another example, when he says, now that's taken from that's every well you don't know it but, in the old days where where moms and dads didn't have TVs or radios what did they do they sat around the dinner table, and they used to read to each other I know because my grandparents used to do that all the time they used to sit down, at the dinner table and then they would start you know throwing garlic phrases at each other and like ball phrases at, each other and stuff and I was there listening to I don't know you know uh DJ, Jazzy Jeff and the French Prince or something totally out of it and now I can appreciate that that how well keyed, in they were with that so when fast takes a misra from ghale and turns it, around into something different says, when he weaves that into the same meter and he uses that you know he's doing something in and he does that with all, his poems right I mean he's taking the style of Ghazal poetry which was all about oh my God lost my loved one and, isn't life terrible and horrible and miserable let's face it all of Ghazal poetry is, about music okay but he doesn't okay all of ghale okay, he's so miserable come on he's like lemon lamenting The Lost World of moral, greatness and you know his aristocratic uh decadences all constantly he is isn't, he okay thank you is, miserable but he's amazing just because somebody is miserable doesn't mean they're not amazing right uh but you, know he's a depressing guy to read but he also pokes fun at his own depression which makes him doubly interesting you, know so what is an erroneous way to understand the superstructure or ideology well, first of all he says yeah we all acknowledge that idea ideology is distinct from the structure it is, asserted that a given political situation solution is ideological that means that it is insufficient for, changing the structure although it thinks that it can do so but on these correct premises is drawn the conclusion, that every ideology is pure appearance useless stupid but that's the wrong conclusion to come, to just because something is a product of capitalism just because something is a product even of feudalism doesn't mean, that you can just dispense with it and say that culture was just useless culture Sufism good God they think that, 

the material and sufis you know this sufis don't believe that the material world as such exists as a material world, they believe everything is basically the emanation of an idea you know it's it's, it's light all of it is light they believe that that's what the suburb is that's what uh, is totally anti-materialist but does that mean I can dismiss all of that because I'm a, materialist and I believe this table actually does exist it's not light does that mean I should dismiss all the Sufi, tradition stop listening stop listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and all the great poetry and all the great heritage Etc and just dismiss it out of hand and say to, means nothing to me because it is pure idealism no you can't do this would be non-serious attitudes he says you can't, dismiss all of it as mere parents useless and stupid no what you've got to understand is that, there you he makes the distinction also between organic and arbitrary organic ideologies are necessary for a given, structure arbitrary ideologies only create individual movements and polemics and so on so first of all you and, foremost you've got to sift the chaff and the grain right you've got to understand that there are lots of ideas, in society some are truly arbitrarily temporary and so on so forth and can be, dismissed but organic ideas that are Central to systems to social systems must be treated with greater care, these are relatively permanent organic ideology will lead to organic movements, that are relatively permanent and these must be separated from conjunctual and arbitrary ideologies and movements that, are occasionally immediate and accidental a common error though consists in an ability in in our, inability to find the correct relationship between what is organic and what is conjunctual so what is now going, to show you is that even that which is conjunctional cannot always be dismissed in the first case there is an excess of, economism or doctrinal pedantry the overestimation of mechanical causes in, the second in excess of ideologism which is the exaggeration of volunteerism and individualistic element so you can have, an exaggeration of ideologism here and an exaggeration of overestimation of mechanical causes when you're looking at, at these courses and you've got to stop doing that you've got to understand the complex interrelationship between, organic between organic ideas organic movements conjunctional movements arbitrary, ideologies they come together in complex ways and we've got to understand them if you want to make real social change he's, a real Craftsman I mean he's sitting in jail but you can give him credit that, he's a real Craftsman he's explaining to you if you want to bring about the feminist Revolution if you want to bring, about a revolution against extremism if you want the end of you know in Pakistan you want the end of I don't know XYZ, oppression of minorities how do you do it how do you convince people how do you, make it happen he is he is the an architect an engineer you could even call him an artist of how to create, construct social movements in any given context or to understand and then create, them so to understand and create them you have to understand the relations of forces who's strong what is the balance, of power we've got to distinguish he says between relations of social forces that is, linked to structure objective independent of human will and in the economic relations between classes then, you've got to look at the relations of political forces Ponzi parties stronger stronger how many people were there at, the climate March who are the enemies of the climate how many others went to the climate March okay right okay there you, go you know who are they what are their views how do they convince people that climate is unimportant you got to, understand that and the mechanics of that right and finally he says between classes or between nations is also the, balance of force of military who's got a stronger military he says that also plays an important role so let's go, through them the first one is kind of self-explanatory so he doesn't really bother with that which is the economy, right the second one he goes into what about politics what happens in politics well he says in politics, social movements evolve at three different levels you can divide them into three different kinds of social movements the first are economic, corporate level which is that people come together for their immediate economic interests uh for example a, trade Union in one place or a student union that you may form and you may say alums we're going to come together to, improve the food at PDC I wish you would not that it's that bad but anyway but that what is that that is an economic, corporate level stuff then you don't Unite with all students here you unite, only with lump students for lumps demands then what if all students combined he says that would be the economic class level it would be where, you'd Advance common interests of the working class common interests of the of students or whatever the case is but, these are still economic interests you're still not vying for political power the third stage is the political, level he says formation of political parties to contest for hegemony over other subordinate groups now you form a, political party of whoever it is represent and then you try to build alliances with others in order to win, the struggle right so he says this is the highest level this is a picture which is quite you can't really see it, quite well and are going to really move to the light but it's the picture of the chartists which was the first working, class party to be created in mid-19th Century England, and then finally he comes to military force quite shocking that he's discussing this while sitting in prison, but he does a trick with it he discusses it but he doesn't talk about classes anymore he talks about Nations because, when he talks about Nations then nobody can object but you can see that he actually means because his interest is not National War but class war right so, he says Independence cannot be won with purely military forces it requires both military and political military ones so, you've got to have you got to combine politics and Military in order to win these sorts of struggles military is, also important though he's trying to say the oppressed Nation he says but actually what he means is the class, will therefore initially oppose the dominant military force with the force which is only political military you, can't have a head-on confrontation with a stronger opponent okay it's just stupid it's not about courage or whatnot, he's trying to say to you you cannot take on the American Military just head on and say Here I Am Rock You Like a, Hurricane no you can't do that right it used to be a famous song when we were kids so what do you do you have to have a, political strategy you have to try to destroy the war potential of the dominant Nation from within that sounds, of Fifth Generation War and you have to compel the dominant military force to, thin out and disperse over a large territory thus nullifying a great power part of its War potential so you've got, to find the right way in which their strategic strength is cannot be deployed against you in one go otherwise you'll, be wiped out so it's like a smaller boxer fighting a bigger boxer the smaller boxers got to keep his distance, he can't get in there and just say all right I'll take your punch and I'll give you one no no can't do that he's got to, go around him he's got to maneuver around him he's going to punch you know find the loopholes Etc never take a, full-on punch from the other side yeah so what about economic crisis in 2008 we, had a huge massive economic crisis and a lot of times we think that an economic crisis ought to generate resistance, against capitalism but then we see Donald Trump get up then we see Boris Johnson come up when we see Le Pen, get up Etc we see all we see Narendra Modi get up not Narendra sorry Narendra Modi Modi get up right you see also you, don't see the left I mean in fact in India the left has gone backwards it used to have 62 seats in Parliament, today it has five in the National Assembly of course they have enormous seats at this provincial level so they, dominate the provincial governments of Kerala and West Bengal and other places Etc but at the national level they've, all the way back to five seats so what's going on so he says gramshi says it may be ruled, out that immediate economic crisis themselves produce fundamental historical events they can simply create a Terrain more favorable to the, dissemination of certain modes of thought and certain and certain ways of posing and resolving questions involving, the entire subsequent development of National Life they create the potentiality that you can that a certain, new idea can become popular but don't make the mistake of thinking that just because Pakistan, is going down economically the left is going to go up politically that's not that's not the way reality, works is explained to you for example the French Revolution did not occur only owing to endemic poverty but also, conflicts related to class prestige played a very important role in the, French Revolution he says and you can't dismiss that economic crisis can lead to contradictory outcomes he says the old, Society may decide to resist and may ensure its itself breathing space by, crushing the opposition or a reciprocal destruction of contending classes and the Peace of the gradia graveyard may be, established perhaps even under the surveillance of a foreign God so it's not at all necessary that you, know just because you represent the truth and the poor and the downtrodden the oppressed that Victory will be yours, in any given specific conflict, so what how do we analyze this and what's the purpose of our analysis if we want to change the world how do we, change the world gramshi can be re the prison read notebooks can be written the prison notebooks or how to change the, world you know you could just recall it that right how do you change the world he says the purpose of analysis is to, reveal the points of least resistance at which the force of will can be most, fruitfully applied this is I think this is genius okay if you're going to try and, change anything in society this is you should put this on your T-shirt or something why because you can't attack everywhere, and you can't attack everything okay some places you attack and those places, are very heavily defended and guarded and those ideas are very strongly entrenched those forces are very, strongly entrenched and all you're going to do by attacking those places is in fact you're going to multiply the, resistance against you you're going to make yourself weaker rather than Stronger by attacking where you are weak, and they are strong ok but if you attack some place where they, are weak and you are strong you are on the right moral ground and people support you and say yeah I don't agree, with everything temu says but on this question you know competitive federalism is the way to go or whatever the case, may be because that's that's shamal's favorite sort of pet project the point is you know if you attack on that on on, on on the pitch where you have a winning chance there then you win lots of people, who are otherwise not necessarily with you and that's what gramshi wants to do they suggest immediate tactical operations, what suggested your analysis shows where where are they strongest where are they, weakest where do I need to attack in order to win for example the the women's scores you tell me where would you need, to attack in order to destroy or undermine patriarchy what would be the weak point of patriarchy what point, would you attack at which you know um you would gain allies and those who, support patriarchy would lose allies versus what are the points where if you attack patriarchy on that point the, Patriarchs would gain allies and you would lose allies those are the things that you need to think about in any, movement whether it's patriarchy or class politics or Democratic politics take General Musharraf right so when I, when I was when I started teaching here at Lums a few years after I started, teaching here at Lums General Musharraf came to power and I have always been opposed to military dictatorship in, Pakistan and I opposed General Musharraf but a huge section of people who are can, be called liberal or Progressive or Democratic said no General he's a nice, guy I said why is he a nice guy he said you know he's got these two doggies and you know he likes music and he likes, Russian Kelly and so on and he did he does that's true and he was a you know as far as military dictators go because, 

I was born in the period when before Isaiah came actually I grew up in the period when Zaya came compared to, military dictators he was a pretty softly military dictator I got to tell you that right but the point is, so do I start attacking him on the fact that he's got to holding two puppies and that he likes music and stuff and how, horrible no but when he made that comment about uh the woman that claimed, that she was raped and he said that uh you know uh maybe she made that claim, because she wanted a Visa and so on uh and then you know when you made that, point when you sort of said hang on a second this is not on and you made that, a strategic part of your campaign then that was a really weak Wicket Musharraf was wrong footed He didn't know where, the ball was coming or going right so then you could it wasn't just that comment but then you said you know we, don't want a ruler like that you made that a point of entry for military dictatorship as a whole to give another, example Imran Khan's doing the same thing I mean he understood a lot a while ago one very important thing which is, that the political Elite all of it of Pakistan is corrupt right so either I, get with the game which he tried to do for a while but there wasn't much of a game to be had because everybody's, already taken the big seats and what he was being offered was well not worth taking and he did the right thing by not, taking it although Musharraf in fact offered him the prime ministership and so on but he was like no it doesn't make, any sense because I have one seat in Parliament and blah blah blah so he understood that so he understood that, one thing that I can do though is I can get these guys on the fact that they are all bloody corrupt so if I make that the, main part of my campaign that's a winning strategy right so he makes he, makes his party tarike what is it what is it oh yeah sorry in South right, I I did that deliberately anyway, you get the picture um mix that the center Plank and then drives that through like a like a pile, 

driver right that's all he can he can talk about it's like almost like Imran Khan can't talk about anything else Under the Sun but now he's so in keyed, into that that one year into government and he's still talking about that instead of getting on with the act of running the country, so sorry if anybody is pro PTI and feels rather unhappy about that comment the, point is only to illustrate to you that to win in politics Grandview is saying, you've got to attack with the enemy is weak and you are strong an analysis helps you find that they, indicate how campaign of political agitation may be May best be launched what language will best be understood by, the masses what will give you greater and greater support for your course, um so finally to conclude he says this whole thing of economism understanding, everything through economics and not being having not having this ability to look at things in this nuanced way he, says is a legacy really not a Marxism but of liberalism economic economism is not Marxism but the direct descendant of, liberalism the state and Civil Society are one in the sense that they serve the same class the latter though that is the, state Works through coercion and the former Civil Society Works through ideological hegemony and this is again, another key point of gramshi he says that trade unionism for example he says, although it belongs to the subaltern class to poor people uh and they uh but the independence in, the Germany of the subordinate group is in fact sacrificed to the intellectual hegemony of the ruling class because trade unionism is an aspect of, laissez-faire liberalism or laissez-faire capitalism right so trade unionism is supposed to restrict the, Revolt of the working class only to negotiating the wage whereas what, gramshi wants them to do is to question the wage system I.E capitalism itself, to continue the problem of emancipation is not considered either the problem of emancipation is not considered as in, fabianism demand or the labor party or pose in an appropriate and infected form for example social democracy or, because of a belief in the possibility of Leaping from class or a society directly into a society of perfect equality with the cynical cynical, economy it is it is left completely open so trade unionism is not a successful, strategy subaltern strategy because even though it is a subaltern movement this is a very cool concept you can have, subaltern movements that don't realize that they are conceding ideological, hegemony to their enemy you can have movements of women who do not realize that in fact they are conceding hegemony, to patriarchy by let's say undertaking a certain slogan or workers movements or, whatever the case may be and gramsi wants you to be able to sift that and understand where you are seeding, essential ground where you are seeding the where you are conceding to your opponent the the the the the the, hegemonic idea there you are basically in trouble you're not going to win even, though you may make a very big splash and get your picture on social media but you can't will not get what you want, also he says this whole tendency we must not compromise we must be uncompromising, in struggle though that is the enemy we are the good guys the good guys fight the bad guys and never in any Hollywood, movie have I seen the good guys have a pleasant conversation with a bad guy except for James Bond uh hence therefore, you know you are on that side and they're going to be no compromise he, says this is not how politics works politics cannot you cannot be successful, if you think in this way in fact hegemony says presupposes compromises, with other interests you want your movement to be successful you've got to compromise with other movements in order, to win them as allies in order to be successful the leading group should make, sacrifice of an economic corporate kind without touching the essential don't give up on your essential but, nonetheless make allies in the big fight against isolate your enemy and fight, against them all forms of electric electoral abstentions also belong to economism or liberalism so that's why he, says okay you know we often think oh the law is against us you know the police is, horrible terrible yeah it is yes the law may not be in your favor oh parliaments, are corrupt or politics is all corrupt we're not going to do any of that what's the result of that it's a, self-defeating strategy you've got to get in the mud he says is what gram she's saying you've got to get into the, mud and you've got to meet with the policewalas and you've got to say here's a gender sensitization program for you, but if you use the word gender sensitization they're going to run the other way so how do you how do you get, in there and get your point of view or here's a labor sensitization program whatever it is how do you maneuver and, convince people that you that the changes that you want to bring about are good that always requires he's saying, compromises and getting into those even into those institutions that you may or, may not necessarily agree with or like creative founded went on to completely, overshadow the Socialist Party of Italy and became the LA one of the largest, communist parties in Europe uh it became massive and gramshi himself, obviously became an intellectual who's read all over the world for precisely, doing what you're saying he perhaps should not have done but he thinks this is a better strategy so he breaks with, them because he thinks they don't have the right strategy he's got it he can do it better and due to a very large extent he does, he does it better in my view um most of the Italian Socialist Party in fact leaves the leadership and joins, gramshi's party later so what gramshi is saying aside from his, strategic vision is very similar to what to what Marx and Engels would have also agreed with for, example the Marx engel's rights according to the materials conception of History the ultimately determining element in history is a production and, reproduction of real life other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted hence if somebody twists this, into saying that the economic element is the only determining one he transforms, that proposition into a meaningless abstract senseless phrase to say that everything can be understood from, economics is not what we are saying okay um similarly gramshi continues that, economism which is he also Associates with the Italian common Socialist Party, um makes no distinction between the relatively permanent organic movement and the fluctuating arbitrary movement, it cannot these are his criticisms all these economic development is reduced to technical change in the instruments of, work it cannot even examine Economic Development very well it is utterly false that people will allow themselves, to be moved by considerations of self-interest and it is entirely true that they are above all motivated by, desire for and Ardent belief in Prestige something that Max Weber talks about, Prestige and Status plays a very important role in our our self-image and, can play a very very important role in how we view our position in society and whether or not we revolt or conform to, society and gramshi is agreeing there economism asks the question who profits directly from the initiative under, consideration and replies with a line of reasoning which is as simplistic as it is relationship the one who profits, directly at a certain fraction of the ruling class and then they get into this argument is Nawaz Sharif benefiting from this, whole politics then begins to dissolve around a few individuals which really is what's going on in Pakistan as well the, whole political question becomes around a few individuals and their economic benefits rather than real questions, about what's what those policies mean for people we start looking for whether, XYZ policy is benefited Imran Khan whether it's benefited whether it's benefit to zadari but that's not all, politics is about you've got to look at how XYZ policy has impacted the people the country as a whole that's, what politics ought to be about so that's the political struggle is reduced to a series of personal affairs, between the one between on the one hand those with the genie in the lamp who know everything on the other those who, are fooled by their own leaders but are so incurably thick that they refuse to believe it, right that's what I mean ramshi seems to be describing Pakistani politics, perfectly because that's what we do all the time right we only pick on things which we think have benefited those, politicians then we make them into big scandals and that's the whole thing that politics revolves around I know time's, up um he wants you to look at the social content of the mass following the, movement what function did this Mass have in the balance of forces what is the political significance of the, demands presented by the leaders you examine the Conformity of the means to the ends what do they want how are they, trying to get it are the two things working together well and only in the last analysis and formulated in the, political and not moralistic terms is the hypothesis considered that such movements would necessarily be perverted, and serve quite different and from those which the mass of the followers expect you've got to start analyzing the, movements for who is in them what are they doing what are their demands, is oh the flannel leaders corrupt and we think that's the end-all and be all of politics we do this all, the time in Pakistani politics he says this is useless get out of there last but not least he has an aversion to, historicism what is that the aversion to compromises is based on the iron conviction that there exists objective, laws of historical development similar and kind to Natural laws together with a belief in a predetermined theology like, that of a religion since favorable conditions are inevitably going to appear and since these in a rather mysterious way would bring about, genetic events it is evident that any deliberate initiative tending to predispose and plan these conditions is, not only useless but even harmful in other words we have become anti-planning we don't want to plan anything because, we think spontaneously history is on my side the truth is on my, side he says it doesn't happen that way the strong uh with those with better, strategy win over those with bad strategy that's how politics really, works so this religious like belief you know we like to watch these movies and in all the movies we watch the good guys, always win there was one movie I watched in which the bad guy won which is called No Country for Old Men and swear I wanted, to go up to the ticket counter and say give me my money back I didn't get my money's worth because we want to believe, the good guys always win but that's not history uh you know you must remember John, Stuart Mill making the same point he made it so eloquently and brilliantly in the case of Jesus Christ right he says, yeah he was a good guy but he didn't win right okay later on Christianity one but, Jesus himself didn't win because to win you not only have to be that's all about Game of Thrones is all, about it's not enough to be a good guy otherwise Ned Stark wouldn't have had his head chopped off in the very first, bloody season he was a good guy he got it's not enough to be a good guy you've, got to know how to play the game and interestingly that reference to Machiavelli is made also, because that's very much Machiavelli right you got to know how to play politics that reference to Machiavelli, is very much there also in the writing of gramshi who often refers to his own, party uh you know the Communist party as the new Prince the modern Prince he, calls it you know saying that you've got to be as smart as Machiavelli wanted you to be in order to make the revolution, right finally gramshi his this beautiful, I want to end with this beautiful quote the old world is dying away and the News, World struggles to come forth now is the time of monsters, climate change I don't know Donald Trump Narendra Modi whoever you want to put in, that category thank you, , ,
