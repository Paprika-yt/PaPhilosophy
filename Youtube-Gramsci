Introduction,what is hegemony Antonio Gramsci and the,prison notebooks I'm Dillon south,Glasgow and I'm your lecturer for this,series in his prison notebooks Antonio,Gramsci,outlined one of the central tenets of,Marxist theorizing the notion of,hegemony for many years Marxist theorist,wanted to understand why the powerless,consent to be dominated by those in,positions of power and one of the ways,they came to understand it was through,the concept of hegemony while he was,What is Hegemony,imprisoned for promoting and,participating in subversive ideas,against the government,the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci,wrote a series of pamphlets called,simply the prison notebooks in them he,further developed the notion of hegemony,a Greek term meaning domination for,Gramsci the ruling class individuals in,positions of power and influence use,hegemonic ideas to gain domination over,the subjugated classes this hegemony of,ideas was not accomplished through using,force it was not accomplished through,using coercion it was accomplished,through getting consent from the masses,of ordinary people this consent was won,through using something called common,sense in other words Gramsci argued that,the ruling classes achieve domination by,manipulating language culture morality,and common sense by common sense we mean,the way that individuals look to common,sense to guide them in their immediate,private concerns as a result individual,common sensical approaches though,helpful in guiding the individual,through their local existence prevents,them from perceiving overarching,institutional socio economic,exploitation made possible by cultural,hegemony common sense means just the way,things are the way things have always,been in other words it does not,challenge the status quo but embraces it,as just common sense,accordingly individuals will not concern,themselves with social and economic,approach,and other areas of discontent in,political financial and social life,let's look at some examples of hegemonic,enterprises first the mass media in,Examples of Hegemony,recent times hegemony has become a,foundational part of mass media the,media is viewed as an independent and,impartial entity,however media have to follow a set of,guidelines and protocols while producing,any form of news since the media are,inherently commercial in nature they,must follow these given rules in order,to do business and to survive this,causes the introduction of a bias that,is favorable to the state and political,system that licenses the media,establishment therefore a partially,untrue version of events is put forth,for assimilation by the public we'll,talk about this more when we do our,special series on the mass media the,second example is the English language,its impact on education is seen by the,widespread use of English as the,language of instruction it has become,important to be proficient in the,English language if one is to excel,professionally this is reinforced by the,fact that majority of the elite,educational institutions provide,education only in English and do not,accept students who are not well versed,in the language this occurs to such an,extent that the knowledge of this,language has become synonymous to being,educated and intelligent and those,lacking it are deemed to be uneducated,and unintelligent the most common,example of hegemony can be observed in,the franchising and globalization of,world cuisine which involves franchises,like KFC Starbucks McDonald's etc it,also includes the practice of foreign,companies who produce products that will,sell well in the foreign market so let's,take a deeper look at the interdependent,and interrelated relationship between,the economically dominant and the,subordinated classes consent and,coercive force are integral,Gramsci argued that although it may not,seem like the ruling class is using,force to maintain its dominance,nevertheless force under writes the,appearance of consent in other words,Gramsci argued that it is a mistake to,think that the ruling class dominates,the subjugated class only by consent,that force is interchangeable with,consent one does not exist without the,other there is a constant negotiation,between the ruling class and the,subordinated classes about what societal,strivings are acceptable or not but for,Conclusion,the dominant class individuals who,possess all the power and all the,influence in a society the goal is,always to maintain ruling class ideas to,incubate societal resources negotiation,is not done through any altruistic,concern for bringing about equal justice,or a more equitable division of,resources or representation by,negotiating with the subjugated classes,the ruling class seeks to contain or,deflect any group or anyone who is,antagonistic when it comes to making,demands on the ruling class,indeed hegemony of the ruling class is,always at risk of being destabilized,this is especially true during times of,societal crises and collapse during,these times hegemony of the ruling class,is reconstituted and recomposed it is,made over so that it addresses the new,situation this kind of negotiation of,back and forth is a dynamic process it,is not static also it is not simply the,case that individuals in the,subordinated classes are brainwashed,neither is it the case that the ruling,class of Germany is on the verge of,collapse that is to say it is a,balancing exercise Gramsci and others,like black law and move revealed that,hegemony is a much more nuanced process,than this considered that workers in the,same economic situation may be naturally,inclined toward Sal,garetty in other words when it comes to,work and other activities there is a,natural bond through similar work,economic situation and other activity,but there is also a kind of accepted,notion of the ruling class ideas that,runs through the subjugated class and,that is perpetuated by the mass media,and other institutions of power in this,way ruling class ideas become pervasive,in a society even though some ideas may,be detrimental to the well-being of,ordinary workers so there remains a,continuous tension that is sometimes,evident and sometimes not,Gramsci and other Marxist theorists,argue that in rare cases because of the,experiences and the conditions under,which subjugated classes struggle this,tension may push subjugated classes in,to struggle against ruling class ideas,this may bring about revolution and with,revolution the notions of common sense,that subordinated classes have been,laboring under coming to conflict with,their everyday lived experience at this,time a new set of ideas politically,conscious and aware that reflect and,benefit the actual lived experience of,the subordinated classes may come into,me I'm dealers with class Co thanks for,watching,please like and subscribe,,
